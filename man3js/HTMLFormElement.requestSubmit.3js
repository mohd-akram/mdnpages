.SH NAME
HTMLFormElement.requestSubmit \- HTMLFormElement: requestSubmit() method

using a specific submit button.
.SH SYNTAX
.IP
.EX
requestSubmit()
requestSubmit(submitter)
.EE
.SS Parameters
.TP
\f[B]submitter\f[R] \f[I](optional)\f[R]
A submit button that is a member of the form.
.RS
.PP
If the \f[CR]submitter\f[R] specifies \f[CR]form*\f[R] attributes, they
will override the form\(cqs submission behavior (e.g.,
\f[CR]formmethod=\(dqPOST\(dq\f[R]).
.PP
If the \f[CR]submitter\f[R] has a \f[CR]name\f[R] attribute or is an
\f[CR]&lt;input type=\(dqimage\(dq&gt;\f[R], its data will be included
in the form submission (e.g., \f[CR]btnName=btnValue\f[R]).
.PP
If you omit the \f[CR]submitter\f[R] parameter, the form element itself
is used as the submitter.
.RE
.SS Return value
None (\f[CR]undefined\f[R]).
.SS Exceptions
.TP
\f[B]TypeError\f[R]
Thrown if the specified \f[CR]submitter\f[R] is not a submit button.
.TP
\f[B]NotFoundError\f[R] \f[B]DOMException\f[R]
Thrown if the specified \f[CR]submitter\f[R] isn\(cqt a member of the
form on which \f[CR]requestSubmit()\f[R] was called.
The submitter must be either a descendant of the form element or must
have a \f[CR]form\f[R] attribute referring to the form.
.SH USAGE NOTES
The obvious question is: Why does this method exist, when we\(cqve had
the \f[CR]submit()\f[R] method since the dawn of time?
.PP
The answer is simple.
\f[CR]submit()\f[R] submits the form, but that\(cqs all it does.
\f[CR]requestSubmit()\f[R], on the other hand, acts as if a submit
button were clicked.
The form\(cqs content is validated, and the form is submitted only if
validation succeeds.
Once the form has been submitted, the \f[CR]submit\f[R] event is sent
back to the form object.
.SH EXAMPLES
In the example below, the form is submitted by attempting to send the
request using \f[CR]requestSubmit()\f[R] if it\(cqs available.
If a submit button with the ID \f[CR]main\-submit\f[R] is found,
that\(cqs used to submit the form.
Otherwise, the form is submitted with no \f[CR]submitter\f[R] parameter,
so it\(cqs submitted directly by the form itself.
.PP
If, on the other hand, \f[CR]requestSubmit()\f[R] isn\(cqt available,
this code falls back to calling the form\(cqs \f[CR]submit()\f[R]
method.
.IP
.EX
\f[B]let\f[R] myForm = document.querySelector(\(dqform\(dq);
\f[B]let\f[R] submitButton = myForm.querySelector(\(dq#main\-submit\(dq);

\f[B]if\f[R] (myForm.requestSubmit) {
  \f[B]if\f[R] (submitButton) {
    myForm.requestSubmit(submitButton);
  } \f[B]else\f[R] {
    myForm.requestSubmit();
  }
} \f[B]else\f[R] {
  myForm.submit();
}
