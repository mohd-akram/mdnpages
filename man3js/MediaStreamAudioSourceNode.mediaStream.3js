.SH NAME
MediaStreamAudioSourceNode.mediaStream \- MediaStreamAudioSourceNode:
mediaStream property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[CR]MediaStreamAudioSourceNode\f[R] interface\[cq]s read\-only
\f[B]\f[CB]mediaStream\f[B]\f[R] property indicates the
\f[CR]MediaStream\f[R] that contains the audio track from which the node
is receiving audio.
.PP
This stream was specified when the node was first created, either using
the \f[CR]MediaStreamAudioSourceNode()\f[R] constructor or the
\f[CR]AudioContext.createMediaStreamSource()\f[R] method.
.SH VALUE
A \f[CR]MediaStream\f[R] representing the stream which contains the
\f[CR]MediaStreamTrack\f[R] serving as the source of audio for the node.
.PP
The user agent uses the first audio track it finds on the specified
stream as the audio source for this node.
However, there is no way to be certain which track that will be on
multi\-track streams.
If the specific track matters to you, or you need to have access to the
track itself, you should use a
\f[CR]MediaStreamTrackAudioSourceNode\f[R] instead.
.SH EXAMPLES
.IP
.EX
const audioCtx = new window.AudioContext();
let options = {
  mediaStream: stream,
};

let source = new MediaStreamAudioSourceNode(audioCtx, options);
console.log(source.mediaStream);
