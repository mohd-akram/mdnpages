.SH NAME
CredentialsContainer.create \- CredentialsContainer: create() method
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f[B]Secure context:\f[R] This feature is available only in secure
contexts (HTTPS).
.PP
The \f[B]\f[CB]create()\f[B]\f[R] method of the
\f[CR]CredentialsContainer\f[R] interface returns a \f[CR]Promise\f[R]
that resolves with a new credential instance based on the provided
options, the information from which can then be stored and later used to
authenticate users via \f[CR]navigator.credentials.get()\f[R].
.PP
This is used by multiple different credential\-related APIs with
significantly different purposes:
.IP \[bu] 2
The Credential Management API uses \f[CR]create()\f[R] to create basic
federated credentials or username/password credentials.
.IP \[bu] 2
The Web Authentication API uses \f[CR]create()\f[R] to create public key
credentials (based on asymmetric cryptography).
.PP
The below reference page starts with a syntax section that explains the
general method call structure and parameters that apply to all the
different APIs.
After that, it is split into separate sections providing parameters,
return values, and examples specific to each API.
.RS
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R] This method is restricted to top\-level browsing
contexts (i.e., a document running directly inside a browser tab, and
not embedded inside another document).
Calls to it from within an \f[CR]<iframe>\f[R] element will resolve
without effect.

\f[CR]Credentials\f[R] object.
It can contain the following properties:
.RS
.TP
\f[B]signal\f[R] \f[I](optional)\f[R]
An \f[CR]AbortSignal\f[R] object instance that allows an ongoing
\f[CR]create()\f[R] operation to be aborted.
An aborted operation may complete normally (generally if the abort was
received after the operation finished) or reject with an
\[lq]\f[CR]AbortError\f[R]\[rq] \f[CR]DOMException\f[R].
.PP
Each of the following properties represents a \f[I]credential type\f[R]
being created.
Only one of them can be specified:
.TP
\f[B]federated\f[R] \f[I](optional)\f[R]
An object containing requirements for creating a federated identify
provider credential.
Bear in mind that the Federated Credential Management API (FedCM)
supersedes this credential type.

creates new credentials via an authenticator \[em] either for
registering a new account or for associating a new asymmetric key pair
with an existing account.
See the Web Authentication API section below for more details.
.RE
.SH CREDENTIAL MANAGEMENT API
The Credential Management API lets a website store and retrieve password
and federated credentials.
These capabilities allow users to sign in without typing passwords, see
the federated account they used to sign in to a site, and resume a
session without the explicit sign\-in flow of an expired session.
.SS \f[CR]federated\f[R] object structure

.SS \f[CR]publicKey\f[R] object structure
The \f[CR]publicKey\f[R] object can contain the following properties:
.TP
\f[B]attestation\f[R] \f[I](optional)\f[R]
A string specifying the relying party\[cq]s preference for how the
attestation statement (i.e., provision of verifiable evidence of the
authenticity of the authenticator and its data) is conveyed during
credential creation.
The value can be one of the following:
.RS
.TP
\f[B]\[dq]none\[dq]\f[R]
Specifies that the relying party is not interested in authenticator
attestation.
This might be to avoid additional user consent for round trips to the
relying party server to relay identifying information, or round trips to
an attestation certificate authority (CA), with the aim of making the
authentication process smoother.
If \f[CR]\[dq]none\[dq]\f[R] is chosen as the \f[CR]attestation\f[R]
value, and the authenticator signals that it uses a CA to generate its
attestation statement, the client app will replace it with a
\[lq]None\[rq] attestation statement, indicating that no attestation
statement is available.
.TP
\f[B]\[dq]direct\[dq]\f[R]
Specifies that the relying party wants to receive the attestation
statement as generated by the authenticator.
.TP
\f[B]\[dq]enterprise\[dq]\f[R]
Specifies that the Relying Party wants to receive an attestation
statement that may include uniquely identifying information.
This is intended for controlled deployments within an enterprise where
the organization wishes to tie registrations to specific authenticators.
.TP
\f[B]\[dq]indirect\[dq]\f[R]
Specifies that the relying party wants to receive a verifiable
attestation statement, but it will allow the client to decide how to
receive it.
For example, the client could choose to replace the authenticator\[cq]s
assertion statement with one generated by an Anonymization CA to protect
user privacy.

Possible values are:
.RS
.TP
\f[B]\[dq]platform\[dq]\f[R]
The authenticator is part of the device WebAuthn is running on (termed a
\f[B]platform authenticator\f[R]), therefore WebAuthn will communicate
with it using a transport available to that platform, such as a
platform\-specific API.
A public key credential bound to a platform authenticator is called a
\f[B]platform credential\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]\[dq]cross\-platform\[dq]\f[R]
The authenticator is not a part of the device WebAuthn is running on
(termed a \f[B]roaming authenticator\f[R] as it can roam between
different devices), therefore WebAuthn will communicate with it using a
cross\-platform transport protocol such as Bluetooth or NFC.
A public key credential bound to a roaming authenticator is called a
\f[B]roaming credential\f[R].
.RS

is usable in authentication requests where the relying party does not
provide credential IDs \[em] \f[CR]navigator.credentials.get()\f[R] is
called with an empty \f[CR]allowCredentials\f[R] value).
The alternative is a \f[B]server\-side credential\f[R], where the
relying party must provide credential IDs in the \f[CR]get()\f[R]
\f[CR]allowCredentials\f[R] value.
Possible values are:
.RS
.TP
\f[B]\[dq]discouraged\[dq]\f[R]
The relying party prefers creation of a server\-side credential, but
will accept a client\-side discoverable credential.
.TP
\f[B]\[dq]preferred\[dq]\f[R]
The relying party strongly prefers creation of a client\-side
discoverable credential, but will accept a server\-side credential.
The user agent should guide the user through setting up user
verification, if needed, to create a discoverable credential.
This takes precedence over the \f[CR]userVerification\f[R] setting.

future.
.PP
If the \f[CR]create()\f[R] call is attempting to create a duplicate
public key credential on an authenticator, the user agent will guide to
user to create the credential using a different authenticator, or fail
if that is not possible.

Examples include specifying whether a returned credential is
discoverable, or whether the relying party will be able to store large
blob data associated with a credential.
.RS
.PP
Extensions are optional and different browsers may recognize different
extensions.
Processing extensions is always optional for the client: if a browser
does not recognize a given extension, it will just ignore it.
