.SH NAME
PannerNode.orientationX \- PannerNode: orientationX property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]orientationX\f[B]\f[R] property of the
\f[CR]PannerNode\f[R] interface indicates the X (horizontal) component
of the direction in which the audio source is facing, in a 3D Cartesian
coordinate space.
.PP
The complete vector is defined by the position of the audio source,
given as (\f[CR]positionX\f[R], \f[CR]positionY\f[R],
\f[CR]positionZ\f[R]), and the orientation of the audio source (that is,
the direction in which it\[cq]s facing), given as
(\f[CR]orientationX\f[R], \f[CR]orientationY\f[R],
\f[CR]orientationZ\f[R]).
.PP
Depending on the directionality of the sound (as specified using the
attributes \f[CR]coneInnerAngle\f[R], \f[CR]coneOuterAngle\f[R], and
\f[CR]coneOuterGain\f[R]), the orientation of the sound may alter the
perceived volume of the sound as it\[cq]s being played.
If the sound is pointing toward the listener, it will be louder than if
the sound is pointed away from the listener.
.PP
The \f[CR]AudioParam\f[R] contained by this property is read only;
however, you can still change the value of the parameter by assigning a
new value to its \f[CR]AudioParam.value\f[R] property.
.SH VALUE
An \f[CR]AudioParam\f[R] whose \f[CR]value\f[R] is the X component of
the direction in which the audio source is facing, in 3D Cartesian
coordinate space.
.SH EXAMPLE
In this example, we\[cq]ll demonstrate how changing the orientation
parameters of a \f[CR]PannerNode\f[R] in combination with
\f[CR]coneInnerAngle\f[R] and \f[CR]coneOuterAngle\f[R] affects volume.
To help us visualize how the orientation vector affects, we can use the

First, let\[cq]s start by writing a utility function to figure out our
\f[I]orientation vector.\f[R] The X and Z components are always at a 90째
to each other, so we can use the sine and cosine functions, which are
offset by the same amount in radians.
However, normally this would mean the \f[CR]PannerNode\f[R] points to
the \f[B]left\f[R] of the listener at 0째 rotation \[en] since
\f[CR]x = cos(0) = 1\f[R] and \f[CR]z = sin(0) = 0\f[R].
It\[cq]s more useful to offset the angle by \-90째, which means the
\f[CR]PannerNode\f[R] will point \f[B]directly at the listener\f[R] at
0째 rotation.
.IP
.EX
\f[I]// this utility converts amount of rotation around the Y axis\f[R]
\f[I]// (i.e. rotation in the \[aq]horizontal plane\[aq]) to an orientation vector\f[R]
\f[B]const\f[R] yRotationToVector = (degrees) \f[B]=>\f[R] {
  \f[I]// convert degrees to radians and offset the angle so 0 points towards the listener\f[R]
  \f[B]const\f[R] radians = (degrees \- 90) * (Math.PI / 180);
  \f[I]// using cosine and sine here ensures the output values are always normalized\f[R]
  \f[I]// i.e. they range between \-1 and 1\f[R]
  \f[B]const\f[R] x = Math.cos(radians);
  \f[B]const\f[R] z = Math.sin(radians);

  \f[I]// we hard\-code the Y component to 0, as Y is the axis of rotation\f[R]
  \f[B]return\f[R] [x, 0, z];
};
.EE
.PP
Now we can create our \f[CR]AudioContext\f[R], an oscillator and a
\f[CR]PannerNode\f[R]:
.IP
.EX
\f[B]const\f[R] context = \f[B]new\f[R] AudioContext();

\f[B]const\f[R] osc = \f[B]new\f[R] OscillatorNode(context);
osc.type = \[dq]sawtooth\[dq];

\f[B]const\f[R] panner = \f[B]new\f[R] PannerNode(context);
panner.panningModel = \[dq]HRTF\[dq];
.EE
.PP
Next, we set up the \f[I]cone\f[R] of our spatialized sound, determining
the area in which it can be heard:
.IP
.EX
\f[I]// this value determines the size of the area in which the sound volume is constant\f[R]
\f[I]// if coneInnerAngle === 30, it means that when the sound is rotated\f[R]
\f[I]// by at most 15 (30/2) degrees either direction, the volume won\[aq]t change\f[R]
panner.coneInnerAngle = 30;
\f[I]// this value determines the size of the area in which the sound volume decreases gradually\f[R]
\f[I]// if coneOuterAngle === 45 and coneInnerAngle === 30, it means that when the sound is rotated\f[R]
\f[I]// by between 15 (30/2) and 22.5 (45/2) degrees either direction,\f[R]
\f[I]// the volume will decrease gradually\f[R]
panner.coneOuterAngle = 45;
\f[I]// this value determines the volume of the sound outside of both inner and outer cone\f[R]
\f[I]// setting it to 0 means there is no sound, so we can clearly hear when we leave the cone\f[R]
\f[I]// 0 is also the default\f[R]
panner.coneOuterGain = 0;
\f[I]// increase the Z position to ensure the cone has an effect\f[R]
\f[I]// (otherwise the sound is located at the same position as the listener)\f[R]
panner.positionZ.setValueAtTime(1, context.currentTime);
.EE
.PP
Having set up the \f[CR]PannerNode\f[R], we can now schedule some
updates to its Y\-axis rotation:
.IP
.EX
\f[I]// calculate the vector for no rotation\f[R]
\f[I]// this means the sound will play at full volume\f[R]
\f[B]const\f[R] [x1, y1, z1] = yRotationToVector(0);
\f[I]// schedule the no\-rotation vector immediately\f[R]
panner.orientationX.setValueAtTime(x1, context.currentTime);
panner.orientationY.setValueAtTime(y1, context.currentTime);
panner.orientationZ.setValueAtTime(z1, context.currentTime);

\f[I]// calculate the vector for \-22.4 degrees\f[R]
\f[I]// since our coneOuterAngle is 45, this will just about make the sound audible\f[R]
\f[I]// if we set it to +/\-22.5, the sound volume will be 0, as the threshold is exclusive\f[R]
\f[B]const\f[R] [x2, y2, z2] = yRotationToVector(\-22.4);
panner.orientationX.setValueAtTime(x2, context.currentTime + 2);
panner.orientationY.setValueAtTime(y2, context.currentTime + 2);
panner.orientationZ.setValueAtTime(z2, context.currentTime + 2);
.EE
.PP
Finally, let\[cq]s connect all our nodes and start the oscillator!
.IP
.EX
osc.connect(panner).connect(context.destination);

osc.start(0);
