.SH NAME
HTMLMediaElement.currentTime \- HTMLMediaElement: currentTime property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[CR]HTMLMediaElement\f[R] interface\[cq]s
\f[B]\f[CB]currentTime\f[B]\f[R] property specifies the current playback
time in seconds.
.PP
Changing the value of \f[CR]currentTime\f[R] seeks the media to the new
time.
.SH VALUE
A double\-precision floating\-point value indicating the current
playback time in seconds.
.PP
If the media is not yet playing, the value of \f[CR]currentTime\f[R]
indicates the time position within the media at which playback will
begin once the \f[CR]play()\f[R] method is called.
.PP
Setting \f[CR]currentTime\f[R] to a new value seeks the media to the
given time, if the media is available.
.PP
For media without a known duration\[em]such as media being streamed
live\[em]it\[cq]s possible that the browser may not be able to obtain
parts of the media that have expired from the media buffer.
Also, media whose timeline doesn\[cq]t begin at 0 seconds cannot be
seeked to a time before its timeline\[cq]s earliest time.
.PP
The length of the media in seconds can be determined using the
\f[CR]duration\f[R] property.

.EX
\f[B]const\f[R] video = document.createElement(\[dq]video\[dq]);
