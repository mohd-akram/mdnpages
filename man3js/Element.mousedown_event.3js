.SH NAME
Element.mousedown_event \- Element: mousedown event
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]mousedown\f[B]\f[R] event is fired at an
\f[CR]Element\f[R] when a pointing device button is pressed while the
pointer is inside the element.
.RS
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R] This differs from the \f[CR]click\f[R] event in that
\f[CR]click\f[R] is fired after a full click action occurs; that is, the
mouse button is pressed and released while the pointer remains inside
the same element.
\f[CR]mousedown\f[R] is fired the moment the button is initially
pressed.
.RE
.SH SYNTAX
Use the event name in methods like \f[CR]addEventListener()\f[R], or set
an event handler property.

.TP
\f[B]MouseEvent.altKey\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]

Returns the horizontal coordinate of the event relative to the current
layer.
.TP
\f[B]MouseEvent.layerY\f[R] \f[I](non\-standard)\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
Returns the vertical coordinate of the event relative to the current
layer.
.TP
\f[B]MouseEvent.metaKey\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
Returns \f[CR]true\f[R] if the meta key was down when the mouse event
was fired.
.TP
\f[B]MouseEvent.movementX\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
The X coordinate of the mouse pointer relative to the position of the
last \f[CR]mousemove\f[R] event.
.TP
\f[B]MouseEvent.movementY\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
The Y coordinate of the mouse pointer relative to the position of the
last \f[CR]mousemove\f[R] event.
.TP
\f[B]MouseEvent.offsetX\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
The X coordinate of the mouse pointer relative to the position of the
padding edge of the target node.
.TP
\f[B]MouseEvent.offsetY\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
The Y coordinate of the mouse pointer relative to the position of the
padding edge of the target node.
.TP
\f[B]MouseEvent.pageX\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
The X coordinate of the mouse pointer relative to the whole document.
.TP
\f[B]MouseEvent.pageY\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
The Y coordinate of the mouse pointer relative to the whole document.
.TP
\f[B]MouseEvent.relatedTarget\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
The secondary target for the event, if there is one.
.TP
\f[B]MouseEvent.screenX\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
The X coordinate of the mouse pointer in screen coordinates.
.TP
\f[B]MouseEvent.screenY\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]

The type of device that generated the event (one of the
\f[CR]MOZ_SOURCE_*\f[R] constants).
This lets you, for example, determine whether a mouse event was
generated by an actual mouse or by a touch event (which might affect the
degree of accuracy with which you interpret the coordinates associated
with the event).
.TP
\f[B]MouseEvent.webkitForce\f[R] \f[I](non\-standard)\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
The amount of pressure applied when clicking.
.TP
\f[B]MouseEvent.x\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
