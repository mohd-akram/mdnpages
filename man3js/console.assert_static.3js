.SH NAME
console.assert_static \- console: assert() static method
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]console.assert()\f[B]\f[R] static method writes an error
message to the console if the assertion is false.
If the assertion is true, nothing happens.
.PP
This feature is available in Web Workers.
.SH SYNTAX
.IP
.EX
assert(assertion)

assert(assertion, obj1)
assert(assertion, obj1, obj2)
assert(assertion, obj1, obj2, /* \&..., */ objN)

assert(assertion, msg)
assert(assertion, msg, subst1)
assert(assertion, msg, subst1, /* \&..., */ substN)
.EE
.SS Parameters
.TP
\f[B]assertion\f[R]
Any boolean expression.
If the assertion is false, a generic message indicating assertion
failure is written to the console.
.TP
\f[B]obj1\f[R] \&... \f[B]objN\f[R]
A list of JavaScript objects to output.
A representation of each of these objects is output to the console after
a generic assertion failure message (which may be different from the
message output when these objects are not present) in the order given
with some type of separation between the message and between each of
them.
There is a special case if \f[CR]obj1\f[R] is a string, which is
described subsequently.
.TP
\f[B]msg\f[R]
A JavaScript string containing zero or more substitution strings, which
are replaced with \f[CR]subst1\f[R] through \f[CR]substN\f[R] in
consecutive order up to the number of substitution strings.
A colon, a space, and then the substituted string are appended to the
generic assertion message to form a detailed assertion message, and the
result is output to the console.
.TP
\f[B]subst1\f[R] \&... \f[B]substN\f[R]
JavaScript objects with which to replace substitution strings within
\f[CR]msg\f[R].
This gives you additional control over the format of the output.
See Using string substitutions for a description of how substitutions
work.
If there are more substutition objects than there are substitution
strings, the extra objects are themselves written to the console after
the detailed assertion message in the same manner as described for
objects written after a generic assertion message.
.SS Return value
None (\f[CR]undefined\f[R]).
.SH EXAMPLES
The following code example demonstrates the use of a JavaScript object
following the assertion:
.IP
.EX
const errorMsg = \[dq]the # is not even\[dq];
for (let number = 2; number <= 5; number++) {
  console.log(\[ga]the # is ${number}\[ga]);
  console.assert(number % 2 === 0, \[dq]%o\[dq], { number, errorMsg });
}
// output:
// the # is 2
// the # is 3
// Assertion failed: {number: 3, errorMsg: \[dq]the # is not even\[dq]}
// the # is 4
// the # is 5
// Assertion failed: {number: 5, errorMsg: \[dq]the # is not even\[dq]}
