.SH NAME
VideoPlaybackQuality.creationTime \- VideoPlaybackQuality: creationTime
property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The read\-only \f[B]\f[CB]creationTime\f[B]\f[R] property on the
\f[CR]VideoPlaybackQuality\f[R] interface reports the number of
milliseconds since the browsing context was created this quality sample
was recorded.
.SH VALUE
A \f[CR]DOMHighResTimeStamp\f[R] object which indicates the number of
milliseconds that elapsed between the time the browsing context was
created and the time at which this sample of the video quality was
obtained.
.PP
For details on how the time is determined, see
\f[CR]Performance.now()\f[R].
.SH EXAMPLES
This example calls \f[CR]getVideoPlaybackQuality()\f[R] to obtain a
\f[CR]VideoPlaybackQuality\f[R] object, then determines what percentage
of frames have been lost by either corruption or being dropped.
If that exceeds 10% (0.1), a function called
\f[CR]lostFramesThresholdExceeded()\f[R] is called to, perhaps, update a
quality indicator to show an increase in frame loss.
