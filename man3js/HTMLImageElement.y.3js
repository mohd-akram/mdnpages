.SH NAME
HTMLImageElement.y \- HTMLImageElement: y property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The read\-only \f[CR]HTMLImageElement\f[R] property
\f[B]\f[CB]y\f[B]\f[R] indicates the y\-coordinate of the
\f[CR]<img>\f[R] element\[cq]s top border edge relative to the root
element\[cq]s origin.
.PP
The \f[CR]x\f[R] and \f[CR]y\f[R] properties are only valid for an image
if its \f[CR]display\f[R] property has the computed value
\f[CR]table\-column\f[R] or \f[CR]table\-column\-group\f[R].
In other words: it has either of those values set explicitly on it, or
it has inherited it from a containing element, or by being located
within a column described by either \f[CR]<col>\f[R] or
\f[CR]<colgroup>\f[R].
.SH VALUE
An integer value indicating the distance in pixels from the top edge of
the element\[cq]s nearest root element to the top edge of the
\f[CR]<img>\f[R] element\[cq]s border box.
The nearest root element is the outermost \f[CR]<html>\f[R] element that
contains the image.
If the image is in an \f[CR]<iframe>\f[R], its \f[CR]y\f[R] is relative
to that frame.
.PP
In the diagram below, the top border edge is the top edge of the blue
padding area.
So the value returned by \f[CR]y\f[R] would be the distance from that
point to the top edge of the content area.

\f[B]Note:\f[R] The \f[CR]y\f[R] property is only valid if the computed
value of the image\[cq]s \f[CR]display\f[R] property is either
\f[CR]table\-column\f[R] or \f[CR]table\-column\-group\f[R]; in other
words, either of those are set directly on the \f[CR]<img>\f[R] or
they\[cq]re inherited from a containing element or by being located
within a column described by either \f[CR]<col>\f[R] or
\f[CR]<colgroup>\f[R].

.SH EXAMPLE
See \f[CR]HTMLImageElement.x\f[R] for example code that demonstrates the
use of the \f[CR]HTMLImageElement.y\f[R] (and
\f[CR]HTMLImageElement.x\f[R]).
