.SH NAME
MouseEvent.button \- MouseEvent: button property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]MouseEvent.button\f[B]\f[R] read\-only property indicates
which button was pressed or released on the mouse to trigger the event.
.PP
This property only guarantees to indicate which buttons are pressed or
released during events caused by pressing or releasing one or multiple
buttons.
As such, it is not reliable for events such as \f[CR]mouseenter\f[R],
\f[CR]mouseleave\f[R], \f[CR]mouseover\f[R], \f[CR]mouseout\f[R], or
\f[CR]mousemove\f[R].
.PP
Users may change the configuration of buttons on their pointing device
so that if an event\(cqs button property is zero, it may not have been
caused by the button that is physically left\(enmost on the pointing
device; however, it should behave as if the left button was clicked in
the standard button layout.
.RS
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R] Do not confuse this property with the
\f[CR]MouseEvent.buttons\f[R] property, which indicates which buttons
are pressed for all mouse events types.
.RE
.SH VALUE
A number representing a given button:
.IP \(bu 2
\f[CR]0\f[R]: Main button, usually the left button or the
un\-initialized state
.IP \(bu 2
\f[CR]1\f[R]: Auxiliary button, usually the wheel button or the middle
button (if present)
.IP \(bu 2
\f[CR]2\f[R]: Secondary button, usually the right button
.IP \(bu 2
\f[CR]3\f[R]: Fourth button, typically the \f[I]Browser Back\f[R] button
.IP \(bu 2
\f[CR]4\f[R]: Fifth button, typically the \f[I]Browser Forward\f[R]
button
.PP
As noted above, buttons may be configured differently to the standard
\(lqleft to right\(rq layout.
A mouse configured for left\-handed use may have the button actions
reversed.
Some pointing devices only have one button and use keyboard or other
input mechanisms to indicate main, secondary, auxiliary, etc.
Others may have many buttons mapped to different functions and button
values.
