RTCIceCandidatePairStats.nominated \- RTCIceCandidatePairStats:
nominated property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]nominated\f[B]\f[R] property of the
\f[CR]RTCIceCandidatePairStats\f[R] dictionary specifies whether or not
the candidate pair described by the underlying
\f[CR]RTCIceCandidatePair\f[R] has been nominated to be used as the
configuration for the WebRTC connection.
.SH VALUE
A Boolean value which is set to \f[CR]true\f[R] by the ICE layer if the
controlling user agent has indicated that the candidate pair should be
used to configure the WebRTC connection between the two peers.
.RS
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R] If more than one candidate pair are nominated at the
same time, the one whose priority is higher will be selected for use.
.RE
.PP
Once a candidate pair has been nominated and the two peers have each
reconfigured themselves to use the specified configuration, the ICE
negotiation process can potentially end (or it can continue, to allow
the connection to adapt to changing conditions).
