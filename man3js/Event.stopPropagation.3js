.SH NAME
Event.stopPropagation \- Event: stopPropagation() method
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]stopPropagation()\f[B]\f[R] method of the
\f[CR]Event\f[R] interface prevents further propagation of the current
event in the capturing and bubbling phases.
It does not, however, prevent any default behaviors from occurring; for
instance, clicks on links are still processed.
If you want to stop those behaviors, see the \f[CR]preventDefault()\f[R]
method.
It also does not prevent propagation to other event\-handlers of the
current element.
If you want to stop those, see \f[CR]stopImmediatePropagation()\f[R].
