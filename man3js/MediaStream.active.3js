.SH NAME
MediaStream.active \- MediaStream: active property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]active\f[B]\f[R] read\-only property of the
\f[CR]MediaStream\f[R] interface returns a Boolean value which is
\f[CR]true\f[R] if the stream is currently active; otherwise, it returns
\f[CR]false\f[R].
A stream is considered \f[B]active\f[R] if at least one of its
\f[CR]MediaStreamTrack\f[R]s does not have its property
\f[CR]MediaStreamTrack.readyState\f[R] set to \f[CR]ended\f[R].
Once every track has ended, the stream\[cq]s \f[CR]active\f[R] property
becomes \f[CR]false\f[R].
.SH VALUE
A Boolean value which is \f[CR]true\f[R] if the stream is currently
active; otherwise, the value is \f[CR]false\f[R].
.SH EXAMPLES
In this example, a new stream whose source is the user\[cq]s local
camera and microphone is requested using \f[CR]getUserMedia()\f[R].
When that stream becomes available (that is, when the returned
\f[CR]Promise\f[R] is fulfilled, a button on the page is updated based
on whether or not the stream is currently active.
