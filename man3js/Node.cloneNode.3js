.SH NAME
Node.cloneNode \- Node: cloneNode() method
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]cloneNode()\f[B]\f[R] method of the \f[CR]Node\f[R]
interface returns a duplicate of the node on which this method was
called.
Its parameter controls if the subtree contained in a node is also cloned
or not.
.PP
Cloning a node copies all of its attributes and their values, including
intrinsic (inline) listeners.
It does \f[I]not\f[R] copy event listeners added using
\f[CR]addEventListener()\f[R] or those assigned to element properties
(e.g., \f[CR]node.onclick = someFunction\f[R]).
Additionally, for a \f[CR]<canvas>\f[R] element, the painted image is
not copied.
.RS
.PP
\f[B]Warning:\f[R] \f[CR]cloneNode()\f[R] may lead to duplicate element
IDs in a document!
.PP
If the original node has an \f[CR]id\f[R] attribute, and the clone will
be placed in the same document, then you should modify the clone\(cqs ID
to be unique.
.PP
Also, \f[CR]name\f[R] attributes may need to be modified, depending on
whether duplicate names are expected.
.RE
.PP
To clone a node to insert into a \f[I]different\f[R] document, use
\f[CR]Document.importNode()\f[R] instead.

.EE
.SS Parameters
.TP
\f[B]deep\f[R] \f[I](optional)\f[R]
If \f[CR]true\f[R], then the node and its whole subtree, including text
that may be in child \f[CR]Text\f[R] nodes, is also copied.
.RS
.PP
If \f[CR]false\f[R], only the node will be cloned.
The subtree, including any text that the node contains, is not cloned.
.PP
Note that \f[CR]deep\f[R] has no effect on void elements, such as the
\f[CR]<img>\f[R] and \f[CR]<input>\f[R] elements.
.RE
.SS Return value
The new \f[CR]Node\f[R] cloned.
The cloned node has no parent and is not part of the document,
\f[I]until\f[R] it is added to another node that is part of the
document, using \f[CR]Node.appendChild()\f[R] or a similar method.
.SH EXAMPLE

\f[B]let\f[R] p = document.getElementById(\(dqpara1\(dq);
\f[B]let\f[R] p_prime = p.cloneNode(\f[B]true\f[R]);
