.SH NAME
Request.integrity \- Request: integrity property
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f[B]Note:\f[R] This feature is available in Web Workers.
.PP
The \f[B]\f[CB]integrity\f[B]\f[R] read\-only property of the
\f[CR]Request\f[R] interface contains the subresource integrity value of
the request.
.SH VALUE
The value that was passed as the \f[CR]options.integrity\f[R] argument
when constructing the \f[CR]Request\f[R].
.PP
If an integrity has not been specified, the property returns
\f[CR]\[aq]\[aq]\f[R].
.SH EXAMPLES
In the following snippet, we create a new request using the
\f[CR]Request()\f[R] constructor (for an image file in the same
directory as the script), then reads the request\[cq]s integrity.
Because the request was created without a specific integrity, the
property returns an empty string.
.IP
.EX
\f[B]const\f[R] myRequest = \f[B]new\f[R] Request(\[dq]flowers.jpg\[dq]);
console.log(myRequest.integrity); \f[I]// \[dq]\[dq]\f[R]
.EE
.PP
In the example below, the request was created with a specific integrity
value, so the property returns that value.
Note that there\[cq]s no validation of the integrity value; the property
returns exactly what was passed in.

.EX
\f[B]const\f[R] myRequest = \f[B]new\f[R] Request(\[dq]flowers.jpg\[dq], {
  integrity: \[dq]sha256\-abc123\[dq],
});
console.log(myRequest.integrity); \f[I]// \[dq]sha256\-abc123\[dq]\f[R]
