.SH NAME
WaveShaperNode.oversample \- WaveShaperNode: oversample property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[CR]oversample\f[R] property of the \f[CR]WaveShaperNode\f[R]
interface is an enumerated value indicating if oversampling must be
used.
Oversampling is a technique for creating more samples (up\-sampling)
before applying a distortion effect to the audio signal.
.PP
Once applied, the number of samples is reduced to its initial numbers.
This leads to better results by avoiding some aliasing, but comes at the
expense of a lower precision shaping curve.
.PP
The possible \f[CR]oversample\f[R] values are:
