\f[B]title\f[R]
Defines a title for the notification, which is shown at the top of the
notification window.
.TP
\f[B]options\f[R] \f[I](optional)\f[R]
An options object containing any custom settings that you want to apply
to the notification.
The possible options are:
.RS
.TP
\f[B]actions\f[R] \f[I](optional)\f[R]
Must be unspecified or an empty array.
\f[CR]actions\f[R] is only supported for persistent notifications fired
from a service worker using
\f[CR]ServiceWorkerRegistration.showNotification()\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]badge\f[R] \f[I](optional)\f[R]
A string containing the URL of the image used to represent the
notification when there isn\(cqt enough space to display the
notification itself; for example, the Android Notification Bar.
On Android devices, the badge should accommodate devices up to 4x
resolution, about 96x96px, and the image will be automatically masked.
.TP
\f[B]body\f[R] \f[I](optional)\f[R]
A string representing the body text of the notification, which is
displayed below the title.
The default is the empty string.
.TP

Arbitrary data that you want associated with the notification.
This can be of any structured\-clonable data type.
The default is \f[CR]null\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]dir\f[R] \f[I](optional)\f[R]
The direction in which to display the notification.
It defaults to \f[CR]auto\f[R], which just adopts the browser\(cqs
language setting behavior, but you can override that behavior by setting
values of \f[CR]ltr\f[R] and \f[CR]rtl\f[R] (although most browsers seem
to ignore these settings.)
.TP
\f[B]icon\f[R] \f[I](optional)\f[R]
A string containing the URL of an icon to be displayed in the
notification.
.TP
\f[B]image\f[R] \f[I](optional)\f[R]
A string containing the URL of an image to be displayed in the
notification.
.TP
\f[B]lang\f[R] \f[I](optional)\f[R]
The notification\(cqs language, as specified using a string representing
a language tag according to RFC 5646: Tags for Identifying Languages
(also known as BCP 47).
See the Sitepoint \c
.UR https://www.sitepoint.com/iso-2-letter-language-codes/
ISO 2 letter language codes

\ page for a simple reference.
The default is the empty string.
.TP
\f[B]renotify\f[R] \f[I](optional)\f[R]
A boolean value specifying whether the user should be notified after a
new notification replaces an old one.
The default is \f[CR]false\f[R], which means they won\(cqt be notified.
If \f[CR]true\f[R], then \f[CR]tag\f[R] also must be set.
.TP
\f[B]requireInteraction\f[R] \f[I](optional)\f[R]
Indicates that a notification should remain active until the user clicks
or dismisses it, rather than closing automatically.
The default value is \f[CR]false\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]silent\f[R] \f[I](optional)\f[R]
A boolean value specifying whether the notification should be silent,
i.e., no sounds or vibrations should be issued regardless of the device
settings.
If set to \f[CR]true\f[R], the notification is silent; if set to
\f[CR]null\f[R] (the default value), the device\(cqs default settings
are respected.
.TP
\f[B]tag\f[R] \f[I](optional)\f[R]
A string representing an identifying tag for the notification.
The default is the empty string.
.TP
\f[B]timestamp\f[R] \f[I](optional)\f[R]
A timestamp, given as Unix time in milliseconds, representing the time
associated with the notification.
This could be in the past when a notification is used for a message that
couldn\(cqt immediately be delivered because the device was offline, or
in the future for a meeting that is about to start.
.TP
\f[B]vibrate\f[R] \f[I](optional)\f[R]
A vibration pattern for the device\(cqs vibration hardware to emit with
the notification.
If specified, \f[CR]silent\f[R] must not be \f[CR]true\f[R].
