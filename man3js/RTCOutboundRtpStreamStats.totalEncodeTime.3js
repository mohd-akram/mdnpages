totalEncodeTime property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]totalEncodeTime\f[B]\f[R] property of the
\f[CR]RTCOutboundRtpStreamStats\f[R] dictionary represents the total
number of seconds spent encoding the \f[CR]framesEncoded\f[R] frames for
this stream (\f[CR]RTCRtpSender\f[R]).
.PP
The average encode time can be calculated by dividing this value by
\f[CR]framesEncoded\f[R].
The time it takes to encode one frame is the time between sending the
encoder a frame and the encoder returning encoded data for that frame.
It does not include any time spent packetizing the resulting data.
.RS

\f[B]Note:\f[R] The property is undefined for audio streams.
