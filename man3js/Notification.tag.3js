.PP
The \f[B]\f[CB]tag\f[B]\f[R] read\-only property of the
\f[CR]Notification\f[R] interface signifies an identifying tag for the
notification, as specified in the \f[CR]tag\f[R] option of the
\f[CR]Notification()\f[R] constructor.
.PP
The idea of notification tags is that more than one notification can
share the same tag, linking them together.
One notification can then be programmatically replaced with another to
avoid the users\[cq] screen being filled up with a huge number of
similar notifications.
.SH VALUE
A string.
.SH EXAMPLES
Our Using the Notifications API article has a good example of tag usage.
