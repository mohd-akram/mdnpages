.SH NAME
MediaTrackSettings.aspectRatio \- MediaTrackSettings: aspectRatio
property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[CR]MediaTrackSettings\f[R] dictionary\[cq]s
\f[B]\f[CB]aspectRatio\f[B]\f[R] property is a double\-precision
floating\-point number indicating the aspect ratio of the
\f[CR]MediaStreamTrack\f[R] as currently configured.
This lets you determine what value was selected to comply with your
specified constraints for this property\[cq]s value as described in the
\f[CR]MediaTrackConstraints.aspectRatio\f[R] property you provided when
calling either \f[CR]getUserMedia()\f[R] or
\f[CR]MediaStreamTrack.applyConstraints()\f[R].
.PP
If needed, you can determine whether or not this constraint is supported
by checking the value of
\f[CR]MediaTrackSupportedConstraints.aspectRatio\f[R] as returned by a
call to \f[CR]MediaDevices.getSupportedConstraints()\f[R].
However, typically this is unnecessary since browsers will ignore any
constraints they\[cq]re unfamiliar with.
.SH VALUE
A double\-precision floating\-point number indicating the current
configuration of the track\[cq]s aspect ratio.
The aspect ratio is computed by taking the track\[cq]s width, dividing
by its height, and rounding the result to ten decimal places.
For example, the standard 16:9 high\-definition aspect ratio can be
computed as 1920/1080, or 1.7777777778.
