.SH NAME
XMLHttpRequest.responseType \- XMLHttpRequest: responseType property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[CR]XMLHttpRequest\f[R] property \f[B]\f[CB]responseType\f[B]\f[R]
is an enumerated string value specifying the type of data contained in
the response.
.PP
It also lets the author change the response type.
If an empty string is set as the value of \f[CR]responseType\f[R], the
default value of \f[CR]text\f[R] is used.
.SH VALUE
A string which specifies what type of data the response contains.
It can take the following values:
.TP
\f[B]\[dq]\[dq]\f[R]
An empty \f[CR]responseType\f[R] string is the same as
\f[CR]\[dq]text\[dq]\f[R], the default type.
.TP
\f[B]\[dq]arraybuffer\[dq]\f[R]
The \f[CR]response\f[R] is a JavaScript \f[CR]ArrayBuffer\f[R]
containing binary data.
.TP
\f[B]\[dq]blob\[dq]\f[R]
The \f[CR]response\f[R] is a \f[CR]Blob\f[R] object containing the
binary data.
.TP
\f[B]\[dq]document\[dq]\f[R]
The \f[CR]response\f[R] is an HTML \f[CR]Document\f[R] or XML
\f[CR]XMLDocument\f[R], as appropriate based on the MIME type of the
received data.
See HTML in XMLHttpRequest to learn more about using XHR to fetch HTML
content.
.TP
\f[B]\[dq]json\[dq]\f[R]
The \f[CR]response\f[R] is a JavaScript object created by parsing the
contents of received data as JSON.
.TP
\f[B]\[dq]text\[dq]\f[R]
The \f[CR]response\f[R] is a text in a string.
.RS
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R] When setting \f[CR]responseType\f[R] to a particular
value, the author should make sure that the server is actually sending a
response compatible with that format.
If the server returns data that is not compatible with the
\f[CR]responseType\f[R] that was set, the value of \f[CR]response\f[R]
will be \f[CR]null\f[R].
.RE
.SS Exceptions
.TP
\f[B]InvalidAccessError\f[R] \f[B]DOMException\f[R]
An attempt was made to change the value of \f[CR]responseType\f[R] on an
\f[CR]XMLHttpRequest\f[R] which is in synchronous mode but not in a
\f[CR]Worker\f[R].
For additional details, see Synchronous XHR restrictions below.
.SH USAGE NOTES
.SS Synchronous XHR restrictions
You cannot change the value of \f[CR]responseType\f[R] in a synchronous
\f[CR]XMLHttpRequest\f[R] except when the request belongs to a
\f[CR]Worker\f[R].
This restriction is designed in part to help ensure that synchronous
operations aren\[cq]t used for large transactions that block the
browser\[cq]s main thread, thereby bogging down the user experience.
.PP
XHR requests are asynchronous by default; they are only placed in
synchronous mode by passing \f[CR]false\f[R] as the value of the
optional \f[CR]async\f[R] parameter when calling \f[CR]open()\f[R].
.SS Restrictions in Workers
Attempts to set the value of \f[CR]responseType\f[R] to
\f[CR]document\f[R] are ignored in a \f[CR]Worker\f[R].
