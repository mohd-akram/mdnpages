represents the smallest positive numeric value representable in
JavaScript.
.SH VALUE
2\[ha]\-1074, or \f[CR]5E\-324\f[R].

.SH DESCRIPTION
\f[CR]Number.MIN_VALUE\f[R] is the smallest positive number (not the
most negative number) that can be represented within float precision
\[em] in other words, the number closest to 0.
The ECMAScript spec doesn\[cq]t define a precise value that
implementations are required to support \[em] instead the spec says,
\f[I]\[lq]must be the smallest non\-zero positive value that can
actually be represented by the implementation\[rq]\f[R].
This is because small IEEE\-754 floating point numbers are \c
.UR https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subnormal_number
denormalized
.UE \c
, but implementations are not required to support this representation,
in which case \f[CR]Number.MIN_VALUE\f[R] may be larger.
.PP
In practice, its precise value in mainstream engines like V8 (used by
Chrome, Edge, Node.js), SpiderMonkey (used by Firefox), and
JavaScriptCore (used by Safari) is 2\[ha]\-1074, or \f[CR]5E\-324\f[R].
.PP
Because \f[CR]MIN_VALUE\f[R] is a static property of \f[CR]Number\f[R],
you always use it as \f[CR]Number.MIN_VALUE\f[R], rather than as a
property of a number value.
.SH EXAMPLES
.SS Using MIN_VALUE
The following code divides two numeric values.
If the result is greater than or equal to \f[CR]MIN_VALUE\f[R], the
\f[CR]func1\f[R] function is called; otherwise, the \f[CR]func2\f[R]
function is called.
