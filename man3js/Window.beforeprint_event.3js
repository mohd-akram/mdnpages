.SH NAME
Window.beforeprint_event \- Window: beforeprint event
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]beforeprint\f[B]\f[R] event is fired when the associated
document is about to be printed or previewed for printing.
.PP
The \f[CR]afterprint\f[R] and \f[CR]beforeprint\f[R] events allow pages
to change their content before printing starts (perhaps to remove a
banner, for example) and then revert those changes after printing has
completed.
In general, you should prefer the use of a \f[CR]\[at]media print\f[R]
CSS at\-rule, but it may be necessary to use these events in some cases.
.SH SYNTAX

an event handler property.
