.SH NAME
SVGLengthList.insertItemBefore \- SVGLengthList: insertItemBefore()
method
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]insertItemBefore()\f[B]\f[R] method of the
\f[CR]SVGLengthList\f[R] interface inserts a new item into the list at
the specified position.
The first item is indexed 0.
If the new item is already in a list, it is removed from its previous
list before it is inserted into this list.
The inserted item is the item itself and not a copy.
If the item is already in this list, note that the index of the item to
insert before is before the removal of the item.
If the index is equal to 0, then the new item is inserted at the front
of the list.
If the index is greater than or equal to the \f[CR]length\f[R], then the
new item is appended to the end of the list.
