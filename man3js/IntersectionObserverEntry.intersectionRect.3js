.SH NAME
IntersectionObserverEntry.intersectionRect \- IntersectionObserverEntry:
intersectionRect property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[CR]IntersectionObserverEntry\f[R] interface\[cq]s read\-only
\f[B]\f[CB]intersectionRect\f[B]\f[R] property is a
\f[CR]DOMRectReadOnly\f[R] object which describes the smallest rectangle
that contains the entire portion of the target element which is
currently visible within the intersection root.
.SH VALUE
A \f[CR]DOMRectReadOnly\f[R] which describes the part of the target
element that\[cq]s currently visible within the root\[cq]s intersection
rectangle.
.PP
This rectangle is computed by taking the intersection of
\f[CR]boundingClientRect\f[R] with each of the \f[CR]target\f[R]`s
ancestors' clip rectangles, with the exception of the intersection
\f[CR]root\f[R] itself.
.SH EXAMPLES
In this simple example, an intersection callback stores the intersection
rectangle for later use by the code that draws the target elements\[cq]
contents, so that only the visible area is redrawn.
.IP
.EX
\f[B]function\f[R] intersectionCallback(entries) {
  entries.forEach((entry) \f[B]=>\f[R] {
    refreshZones.push({
      element: entry.target,
      rect: entry.intersectionRect,
    });
  });
