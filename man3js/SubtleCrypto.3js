SubtleCrypto \- SubtleCrypto
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f[B]Secure context:\f[R] This feature is available only in secure
contexts (HTTPS).
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R] This feature is available in Web Workers.
.PP
The \f[B]\f[CB]SubtleCrypto\f[B]\f[R] interface of the Web Crypto API
provides a number of low\-level cryptographic functions.
.PP
The interface name includes the term \[lq]subtle\[rq] to indicate that
many of its algorithms have subtle usage requirements, and hence that it
must be used carefully in order to provide suitable security guarantees.
.PP
An instance of \f[CR]SubtleCrypto\f[R] is available as the
\f[CR]subtle\f[R] property of the \f[CR]Crypto\f[R] interface, which in
turn is available in windows through the \f[CR]Window.crypto\f[R]
property and in workers through the \f[CR]WorkerGlobalScope.crypto\f[R]
property.
.RS
.PP
\f[B]Warning:\f[R] This API provides a number of low\-level
cryptographic primitives.
It\[cq]s very easy to misuse them, and the pitfalls involved can be very
subtle.
.PP
Even assuming you use the basic cryptographic functions correctly,
secure key management and overall security system design are extremely
hard to get right, and are generally the domain of specialist security
experts.
.PP
Errors in security system design and implementation can make the
security of the system completely ineffective.
.PP
Please learn and experiment, but don\[cq]t guarantee or imply the
security of your work before an individual knowledgeable in this subject
matter thoroughly reviews it.
The \c
.UR https://www.crypto101.io/
Crypto 101 Course
.UE \c
\ can be a great place to start learning about the design and
implementation of secure systems.

.SH USING SUBTLECRYPTO
We can split the functions implemented by this API into two groups:
cryptography functions and key management functions.
.SS Cryptography functions
These are the functions you can use to implement security features such
as privacy and authentication in a system.
The \f[CR]SubtleCrypto\f[R] API provides the following cryptography
functions:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]sign()\f[R] and \f[CR]verify()\f[R]: create and verify digital
signatures.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]encrypt()\f[R] and \f[CR]decrypt()\f[R]: encrypt and decrypt data.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]digest()\f[R]: create a fixed\-length, collision\-resistant digest
of some data.
.SS Key management functions
Except for \f[CR]digest()\f[R], all the cryptography functions in the
API use cryptographic keys.
In the \f[CR]SubtleCrypto\f[R] API a cryptographic key is represented
using a \f[CR]CryptoKey\f[R] object.
To perform operations like signing and encrypting, you pass a
\f[CR]CryptoKey\f[R] object into the \f[CR]sign()\f[R] or
\f[CR]encrypt()\f[R] function.
.SS Generating and deriving keys
The \f[CR]generateKey()\f[R] and \f[CR]deriveKey()\f[R] functions both
create a new \f[CR]CryptoKey\f[R] object.
.PP
The difference is that \f[CR]generateKey()\f[R] will generate a new
distinct key value each time you call it, while \f[CR]deriveKey()\f[R]
derives a key from some initial keying material.
If you provide the same keying material to two separate calls to
\f[CR]deriveKey()\f[R], you will get two \f[CR]CryptoKey\f[R] objects
that have the same underlying value.
This is useful if, for example, you want to derive an encryption key
from a password and later derive the same key from the same password to
decrypt the data.
.SS Importing and exporting keys
To make keys available outside your app, you need to export the key, and
that\[cq]s what \f[CR]exportKey()\f[R] is for.
You can choose one of a number of export formats.
.PP
The inverse of \f[CR]exportKey()\f[R] is \f[CR]importKey()\f[R].
You can import keys from other systems, and support for standard formats
like \c
.UR https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5208
PKCS #8
.UE \c
\ and \c
.UR https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7517
JSON Web Key
.UE \c
\ helps you do this.
The \f[CR]exportKey()\f[R] function exports the key in an unencrypted
format.
.PP
If the key is sensitive you should use \f[CR]wrapKey()\f[R], which
exports the key and then encrypts it using another key; the API calls a
\[lq]key\-wrapping key\[rq].
.PP
The inverse of \f[CR]wrapKey()\f[R] is \f[CR]unwrapKey()\f[R], which
decrypts then imports the key.
.SS Storing keys
\f[CR]CryptoKey\f[R] is a serializable object, which allows keys to be
stored and retrieved using standard web storage APIs.
.PP
The specification expects that most developers will use the IndexedDB
API, storing \f[CR]CryptoKey\f[R] objects against some key string
identifier that is meaningful to the application, along with any other
metadata it finds useful.
This allows the storage and retrieval of the \f[CR]CryptoKey\f[R]
without having to expose its underlying key material to the application
or the JavaScript environment.
.SS Supported algorithms
The cryptographic functions provided by the Web Crypto API can be
performed by one or more different \f[I]cryptographic algorithms\f[R]:
the \f[CR]algorithm\f[R] argument to the function indicates which
algorithm to use.
Some algorithms need extra parameters: in these cases the
\f[CR]algorithm\f[R] argument is a dictionary object that includes the
extra parameters.
.PP
The table below summarizes which algorithms are suitable for which
cryptographic operations:
