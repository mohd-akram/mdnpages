.SH NAME
MediaTrackSettings.sampleRate \- MediaTrackSettings: sampleRate property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[CR]MediaTrackSettings\f[R] dictionary\[cq]s
\f[B]\f[CB]sampleRate\f[B]\f[R] property is an integer indicating how
many audio samples per second the \f[CR]MediaStreamTrack\f[R] is
currently configured for.
This lets you determine what value was selected to comply with your
specified constraints for this property\[cq]s value as described in the
\f[CR]MediaTrackConstraints.sampleRate\f[R] property you provided when
calling either \f[CR]getUserMedia()\f[R] or
\f[CR]MediaStreamTrack.applyConstraints()\f[R].
.PP
If needed, you can determine whether or not this constraint is supported
by checking the value of
\f[CR]MediaTrackSupportedConstraints.sampleRate\f[R] as returned by a
call to \f[CR]MediaDevices.getSupportedConstraints()\f[R].
However, typically this is unnecessary since browsers will ignore any
constraints they\[cq]re unfamiliar with.
.SH VALUE
An integer value indicating how many samples each second of audio data
includes.
Common values include 44,100 (standard CD audio), 48,000 (standard
digital audio), 96,000 (commonly used in audio mastering and
post\-production), and 192,000 (used for high\-resolution audio in
professional recording and mastering sessions).
However, lower values are often used to reduce bandwidth requirements;
8,000 samples per second is adequate for comprehensible albeit imperfect
human speech, and both 11,025 FPS and 22,050 FPS are often used for
low\-bandwidth, reduced quality sound and music.
