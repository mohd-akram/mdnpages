.SH NAME
IntersectionObserverEntry.boundingClientRect \-
IntersectionObserverEntry: boundingClientRect property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[CR]IntersectionObserverEntry\f[R] interface\[cq]s read\-only
\f[B]\f[CB]boundingClientRect\f[B]\f[R] property returns a
\f[CR]DOMRectReadOnly\f[R] which in essence describes a rectangle
describing the smallest rectangle that contains the entire target
element.
.SH VALUE
A \f[CR]DOMRectReadOnly\f[R] which describes the smallest rectangle that
contains every part of the target element whose intersection change is
being described.
This value is obtained using the same algorithm as
\f[CR]Element.getBoundingClientRect()\f[R], so refer to that article for
details on precisely what is done to obtain this rectangle and what is
and is not included within its bounds.
.PP
In the general case, however, it\[cq]s safe to think of this as the
bounds rectangle of the target element.
