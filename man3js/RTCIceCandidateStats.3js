.SH NAME
RTCIceCandidateStats \- RTCIceCandidateStats
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]RTCIceCandidateStats\f[B]\f[R] dictionary of the WebRTC
API is used to report statistics related to an
\f[CR]RTCIceCandidate\f[R].
.PP
The statistics can be obtained by iterating the
\f[CR]RTCStatsReport\f[R] returned by
\f[CR]RTCPeerConnection.getStats()\f[R] until you find a report with the
\f[CR]type\f[R] of \f[CR]local\-candidate\f[R].
.SH INSTANCE PROPERTIES
.TP
\f[B]address\f[R] \f[I](optional)\f[R]
A string containing the address of the candidate.
This value may be an IPv4 address, an IPv6 address, or a
fully\-qualified domain name.
This property was previously named \f[CR]ip\f[R] and only accepted IP
addresses.
.TP
\f[B]candidateType\f[R]
A string matching one of the values in \f[CR]RTCIceCandidate.type\f[R],
indicating what kind of candidate the object provides statistics for.
.TP
\f[B]deleted\f[R] \f[I](optional)\f[R]
A Boolean value indicating whether or not the candidate has been
released or deleted; the default value is \f[CR]false\f[R].
For local candidates, its value is \f[CR]true\f[R] if the candidate has
been deleted or released.
For host candidates, \f[CR]true\f[R] means that any network resources
(usually a network socket) associated with the candidate have already
been released.
For TURN candidates, the TURN allocation is no longer active for deleted
candidates.
This property is not present for remote candidates.
.TP
\f[B]port\f[R] \f[I](optional)\f[R]
The network port number used by the candidate.
.TP
\f[B]priority\f[R] \f[I](optional)\f[R]
The candidate\[cq]s priority, corresponding to
\f[CR]RTCIceCandidate.priority\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]protocol\f[R] \f[I](optional)\f[R]
A string specifying the protocol (\f[CR]tcp\f[R] or \f[CR]udp\f[R]) used
to transmit data on the \f[CR]port\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]relayProtocol\f[R] \f[I](optional)\f[R]
A string identifying the protocol used by the endpoint for communicating
with the TURN server; valid values are \f[CR]tcp\f[R], \f[CR]udp\f[R],
and \f[CR]tls\f[R].
Only present for local candidates.
.TP
\f[B]transportId\f[R]
A string uniquely identifying the transport object that was inspected in
order to obtain the \f[CR]RTCTransportStats\f[R] associated with the
candidate corresponding to these statistics.
.TP
\f[B]url\f[R] \f[I](optional)\f[R]
For local candidates, the \f[CR]url\f[R] property is the URL of the ICE
server from which the candidate was received.
This URL matches the one included in the
\f[CR]RTCPeerConnectionIceEvent\f[R] object representing the
\f[CR]icecandidate\f[R] event that delivered the candidate to the local
peer.
.SS Common instance properties
The following properties are common to all WebRTC statistics objects.
.TP
\f[B]id\f[R]
A string that uniquely identifies the object that is being monitored to
produce this set of statistics.
.TP
\f[B]timestamp\f[R]
A \f[CR]DOMHighResTimeStamp\f[R] object indicating the time at which the
sample was taken for this statistics object.
.TP
\f[B]type\f[R]
A string with the value \f[CR]\[dq]local\-candidate\[dq]\f[R],
indicating the type of statistics that the object contains.
