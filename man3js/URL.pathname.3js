.SH NAME
URL.pathname \- URL: pathname property
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f[B]Note:\f[R] This feature is available in Web Workers.
.PP
The \f[B]\f[CB]pathname\f[B]\f[R] property of the \f[CR]URL\f[R]
interface represents a location in a hierarchical structure.
It is a string constructed from a list of path segments, each of which
is prefixed by a \f[CR]/\f[R] character.
.PP
HTTPS, HTTP, or other URLs with \c
.UR https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986#section-1.2.3
hierarchical schemes
.UE \c
\ (which the URL standard calls \[lq]\c
.UR https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#special-scheme
special schemes
.UE \c
\[rq]) always have at least one (invisible) path segment: the empty
string.
The \f[CR]pathname\f[R] value for such URLs will therefore always have
at least one \f[CR]/\f[R] character.
.PP
For non\-hierarchical schemes, if the URL has no path segments, the
value of its \f[CR]pathname\f[R] property will be the empty string.
.SH VALUE
A string.
.SH EXAMPLES
.SS Pathname with invisible segment
The URL below has just one path segment, the empty string.
The \f[CR]pathname\f[R] value is constructed by prefixing a \f[CR]/\f[R]
character to the empty string.
.IP
.EX
\f[B]const\f[R] url = \f[B]new\f[R] URL(\[dq]https://developer.mozilla.org\[dq]);
console.log(url.pathname); \f[I]// Logs \[dq]/\[dq]\f[R]
.EE
.SS Pathname with query parameters
The example below shows the pathname for an HTTPS URL with query
parameters.
.IP
.EX
\f[B]const\f[R] url = \f[B]new\f[R] URL(
  \[dq]https://developer.mozilla.org/en\-US/docs/Web/API/URL/pathname?q=value\[dq],
);
console.log(url.pathname); \f[I]// Logs \[dq]/en\-US/docs/Web/API/URL/pathname\[dq]\f[R]
.EE
.PP
The query parameters do not form part of the path.
Note that some systems use the \f[CR];\f[R] and \f[CR]=\f[R] characters
to delimit parameters and parameter values applicable to a path segment.
For example, with the URL
\f[CR]https://example.org/users;id=42/tasks;state=open?sort=modified\f[R],
a system might extract and use the path segment parameters
\f[CR]id=42\f[R] and \f[CR]state=open\f[R] from the path segments
\f[CR]users;id=42\f[R] and \f[CR]tasks;state=open\f[R].
.SS Pathname with a slug
Some systems define the term \f[I]slug\f[R] to mean the final segment of
a non\-empty path if it identifies a page in human\-readable keywords.
For example, the URL below has the slug
\f[CR]this\-that\-other\-outre\-collection\f[R].
.IP
.EX
\f[B]const\f[R] url = \f[B]new\f[R] URL(
  \[dq]https://example.org/articles/this\-that\-other\-outre\-collection\[dq],
);
console.log(url.pathname); \f[I]// Logs \[dq]/articles/this\-that\-other\-outre\-collection\[dq]\f[R]
