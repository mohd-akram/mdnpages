.SH NAME
URL.pathname \- URL: pathname property
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f[B]Note:\f[R] This feature is available in Web Workers.
.PP
The \f[B]\f[CB]pathname\f[B]\f[R] property of the \f[CR]URL\f[R]
interface represents a location in a hierarchical structure.
It is a string constructed from a list of path segments, each of which
is prefixed by a \f[CR]/\f[R] character.
If the URL has no path segments, the value of its \f[CR]pathname\f[R]
property will be the empty string.
.PP
URLs such as \f[CR]https\f[R] and \f[CR]http\f[R] URLs that have \c
.UR https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986#section-1.2.3
hierarchical schemes
.UE \c
\ (which the URL standard calls \[lq]\c
.UR https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#special-scheme
special schemes
.UE \c
\[rq]) always have at least one (invisible) path segment: the empty
string.
Thus the \f[CR]pathname\f[R] value for such \[lq]special scheme\[rq]
URLs can never be the empty string, but will instead always have a least
one \f[CR]/\f[R] character.
.PP
For example, the URL \f[CR]https://developer.mozilla.org\f[R] has just
one path segment: the empty string, so its \f[CR]pathname\f[R] value is
constructed by prefixing a \f[CR]/\f[R] character to the empty string.
.PP
Some systems define the term \f[I]slug\f[R] to mean the final segment of
a non\-empty path if it identifies a page in human\-readable keywords.
For example, the URL
\f[CR]https://example.org/articles/this\-that\-other\-outre\-collection\f[R]
has \f[CR]this\-that\-other\-outre\-collection\f[R] as its slug.
.PP
Some systems use the \f[CR];\f[R] and \f[CR]=\f[R] characters to delimit
parameters and parameter values applicable to a path segment.
For example, with the URL
\f[CR]https://example.org/users;id=42/tasks;state=open?sort=modified\f[R],
a system might extract and use the path segment parameters
\f[CR]id=42\f[R] and \f[CR]state=open\f[R] from the path segments
\f[CR]users;id=42\f[R] and \f[CR]tasks;state=open\f[R].
.SH VALUE
A string.

\f[B]const\f[R] url = \f[B]new\f[R] URL(
