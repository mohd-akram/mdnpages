.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]ariaAutoComplete\f[B]\f[R] property of the
\f[CR]ElementInternals\f[R] interface reflects the value of the
\f[CR]aria\-autocomplete\f[R] attribute, which indicates whether
inputting text could trigger display of one or more predictions of the
user\[cq]s intended value for a combobox, searchbox, or textbox and
specifies how predictions would be presented if they were made.

\f[B]Note:\f[R] Setting aria attributes on \f[CR]ElementInternals\f[R]
allows default semantics to be defined on a custom element.
These may be overwritten by author\-defined attributes, but ensure that
default semantics are retained should the author delete those
attributes, or fail to add them at all.
