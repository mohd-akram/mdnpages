.SH NAME
DOMPoint \- DOMPoint
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f[B]Note:\f[R] This feature is available in Web Workers.
.PP
A \f[B]\f[CB]DOMPoint\f[B]\f[R] object represents a 2D or 3D point in a
coordinate system; it includes values for the coordinates in up to three
dimensions, as well as an optional perspective value.
\f[CR]DOMPoint\f[R] is based on \f[CR]DOMPointReadOnly\f[R] but allows
its properties\(cq values to be changed.
.PP
In general, a positive \f[CR]x\f[R] component represents a position to
the right of the origin, a positive \f[CR]y\f[R] component is downward
from the origin, and a positive \f[CR]z\f[R] component extends outward
from the screen (in other words, toward the user).
.SH CONSTRUCTOR
.TP
\f[B]DOMPoint()\f[R]
Creates and returns a new \f[CR]DOMPoint\f[R] object given the values of
zero or more of its coordinate components and optionally the
\f[CR]w\f[R] perspective value.
You can also use an existing \f[CR]DOMPoint\f[R] or
\f[CR]DOMPointReadOnly\f[R] or an object to create a new point by
calling the \f[CR]DOMPoint.fromPoint()\f[R] static method.
.SH INSTANCE PROPERTIES
\f[I]\f[CI]DOMPoint\f[I] may also inherit properties from its parent,
\f[CI]DOMPointReadOnly\f[I].\f[R]
.TP
\f[B]DOMPoint.x\f[R]
The \f[CR]x\f[R] coordinate of the \f[CR]DOMPoint\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]DOMPoint.y\f[R]
The \f[CR]y\f[R] coordinate of the \f[CR]DOMPoint\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]DOMPoint.z\f[R]
The \f[CR]z\f[R] coordinate of the \f[CR]DOMPoint\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]DOMPoint.w\f[R]
The perspective value of the \f[CR]DOMPoint\f[R].
.SH INSTANCE METHODS
\f[I]\f[CI]DOMPoint\f[I] inherits instance methods from its parent,
\f[CI]DOMPointReadOnly\f[I].\f[R]
.SH STATIC METHODS
\f[I]\f[CI]DOMPoint\f[I] may also inherit static methods from its
parent, \f[CI]DOMPointReadOnly\f[I].\f[R]
.TP
\f[B]DOMPoint.fromPoint()\f[R]
Creates a new mutable \f[CR]DOMPoint\f[R] object given an existing point
(or an object containing matching properties), which provides the values
for its properties.
.SH EXAMPLES
In the WebXR Device API, \f[CR]DOMPointReadOnly\f[R] values represent
positions and orientations.
In the following snippet, the pose of the XR device (such as a VR
headset or phone with AR capabilities) can be retrieved by calling using
\f[CR]XRFrame.getViewerPose()\f[R] during an \f[CR]XRSession\f[R]
animation frame, then accessing the resulting \f[CR]XRPose\f[R]\(cqs
\f[CR]transform\f[R] property, which contains two
\f[CR]DOMPointReadOnly\f[R] attributes: \f[CR]position\f[R] as a vector
and \f[CR]orientation\f[R] as a quaternion.

.EX
\f[B]function\f[R] onXRFrame(time, xrFrame) {
  \f[B]let\f[R] viewerPose = xrFrame.getViewerPose(xrReferenceSpace);

  \f[B]if\f[R] (viewerPose) {
    \f[B]let\f[R] position = viewerPose.transform.position;
    \f[B]let\f[R] orientation = viewerPose.transform.orientation;

    console.log(
      \(gaXR Viewer Position: {x: ${roundToTwo(position.x)}, y: ${roundToTwo(
        position.y,
      )}, z: ${roundToTwo(position.z)}\(ga,
    );

    console.log(
      \(gaXR Viewer Orientation: {x: ${roundToTwo(orientation.x)}, y: ${roundToTwo(
        orientation.y,
      )}, z: ${roundToTwo(orientation.z)}, w: ${roundToTwo(orientation.w)}\(ga,
    );
