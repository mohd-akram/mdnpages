.SH NAME
WebSocket.send \- WebSocket: send() method
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f[B]Note:\f[R] This feature is available in Web Workers.
.PP
The \f[B]\f[CB]WebSocket.send()\f[B]\f[R] method enqueues the specified
data to be transmitted to the server over the WebSocket connection,
increasing the value of \f[CR]bufferedAmount\f[R] by the number of bytes
needed to contain the data.
If the data can\(cqt be sent (for example, because it needs to be
buffered but the buffer is full), the socket is closed automatically.
The browser will throw an exception if you call \f[CR]send()\f[R] when
the connection is in the \f[CR]CONNECTING\f[R] state.
If you call \f[CR]send()\f[R] when the connection is in the
\f[CR]CLOSING\f[R] or \f[CR]CLOSED\f[R] states, the browser will
silently discard the data.

.SS Parameters
.TP
\f[B]data\f[R]
The data to send to the server.
It may be one of the following types:
.RS
.TP
\f[B]string\f[R]
A text string.
The string is added to the buffer in UTF\-8 format, and the value of
\f[CR]bufferedAmount\f[R] is increased by the number of bytes required
to represent the UTF\-8 string.
.TP
\f[B]ArrayBuffer\f[R]
You can send the underlying binary data used by a typed array object;
its binary data contents are queued in the buffer, increasing the value
of \f[CR]bufferedAmount\f[R] by the requisite number of bytes.
.TP
\f[B]Blob\f[R]
Specifying a \f[CR]Blob\f[R] enqueues the blob\(cqs raw data to be
transmitted in a binary frame (the \f[CR]Blob.type\f[R] is ignored).
The value of \f[CR]bufferedAmount\f[R] is increased by the byte size of
that raw data.
.TP
\f[B]TypedArray\f[R] or a \f[B]DataView\f[R]
You can send any JavaScript typed array object as a binary frame; its
binary data contents are queued in the buffer, increasing the value of
\f[CR]bufferedAmount\f[R] by the requisite number of bytes.
.RE
.SS Return value
None (\f[CR]undefined\f[R]).
.SS Exceptions
.TP
\f[B]InvalidStateError\f[R] \f[B]DOMException\f[R]
Thrown if \f[CR]WebSocket.readyState\f[R] is \f[CR]CONNECTING\f[R].
