.SH NAME
IntersectionObserver.rootMargin \- IntersectionObserver: rootMargin
property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[CR]IntersectionObserver\f[R] interface\(cqs read\-only
\f[B]\f[CB]rootMargin\f[B]\f[R] property is a string with syntax similar
to that of the CSS \f[CR]margin\f[R] property.
Each side of the rectangle represented by \f[CR]rootMargin\f[R] is added
to the corresponding side in the \f[CR]root\f[R] element\(cqs bounding
box before the intersection test is performed.
This lets you, for example, adjust the bounds outward so that the target
element is considered 100% visible even if a certain number of pixels
worth of width or height is clipped away, or treat the target as
partially hidden if an edge is too close to the edge of the root\(cqs
bounding box.
.PP
See how intersections are calculated for a more in\-depth look at the
root margin and how it works with the root\(cqs bounding box.
.SH VALUE
A string, formatted similarly to the CSS \f[CR]margin\f[R] property\(cqs
value, which contains offsets for one or more sides of the root\(cqs
bounding box.
These offsets are added to the corresponding values in the root\(cqs
bounding box before the intersection between the resulting rectangle and
the target element\(cqs bounds.
.PP
The string returned by this property may not match the one specified
when the \f[CR]IntersectionObserver\f[R] was instantiated.
The browser is permitted to alter the values
.PP
If \f[CR]rootMargin\f[R] isn\(cqt specified when the object was
instantiated, it defaults to the string
\f[CR]\(dq0px 0px 0px 0px\(dq\f[R], meaning that the intersection will
be computed between the root element\(cqs unmodified bounds rectangle
and the target\(cqs bounds.
How intersections are calculated describes how the \f[CR]rootMargin\f[R]
is used in more detail.
