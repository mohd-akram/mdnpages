.SH NAME
IntersectionObserver.rootMargin \- IntersectionObserver: rootMargin
property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[CR]IntersectionObserver\f[R] interface\[cq]s read\-only
\f[B]\f[CB]rootMargin\f[B]\f[R] property is a string with syntax similar
to that of the CSS \f[CR]margin\f[R] property.
Each side of the rectangle represented by \f[CR]rootMargin\f[R] is added
to the corresponding side in the \f[CR]root\f[R] element\[cq]s bounding
box before the intersection test is performed.
This lets you, for example, adjust the bounds outward so that the target
element is considered 100% visible even if a certain number of pixels
worth of width or height is clipped away, or treat the target as
partially hidden if an edge is too close to the edge of the root\[cq]s
bounding box.
.PP
See how intersections are calculated for a more in\-depth look at the
root margin and how it works with the root\[cq]s bounding box.
.SH VALUE
A string, formatted similarly to the CSS \f[CR]margin\f[R]
property\[cq]s value, which contains offsets for one or more sides of
the root\[cq]s bounding box.
These offsets are added to the corresponding values in the root\[cq]s
bounding box before the intersection between the resulting rectangle and
the target element\[cq]s bounds.
.PP
The string returned by this property may not match the one specified
when the \f[CR]IntersectionObserver\f[R] was instantiated.
The browser is permitted to alter the values
.PP
If \f[CR]rootMargin\f[R] isn\[cq]t specified when the object was
instantiated, it defaults to the string
\f[CR]\[dq]0px 0px 0px 0px\[dq]\f[R], meaning that the intersection will
be computed between the root element\[cq]s unmodified bounds rectangle
and the target\[cq]s bounds.
How intersections are calculated describes how the \f[CR]rootMargin\f[R]
is used in more detail.
