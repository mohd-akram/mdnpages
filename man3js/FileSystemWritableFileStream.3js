.SH NAME
FileSystemWritableFileStream \- FileSystemWritableFileStream
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f[B]Secure context\f[R]: This feature is available only in secure
contexts (HTTPS).This feature is available in Web Workers.
.PP
The \f[B]\f[CB]FileSystemWritableFileStream\f[B]\f[R] interface of the
File System API is a \f[CR]WritableStream\f[R] object with additional
convenience methods, which operates on a single file on disk.
The interface is accessed through the
\f[CR]FileSystemFileHandle.createWritable()\f[R] method.
.SH INSTANCE PROPERTIES
\f[I]Inherits properties from its parent,
\f[CI]WritableStream\f[I].\f[R]
.SH INSTANCE METHODS
\f[I]Inherits methods from its parent, \f[CI]WritableStream\f[I].\f[R]
.TP
\f[B]FileSystemWritableFileStream.write()\f[R]
Writes content into the file the method is called on, at the current
file cursor offset.
.TP
\f[B]FileSystemWritableFileStream.seek()\f[R]
Updates the current file cursor offset to the position (in bytes)
specified.
.TP
\f[B]FileSystemWritableFileStream.truncate()\f[R]
Resizes the file associated with the stream to be the specified size in
bytes.
.SH EXAMPLES
The following asynchronous function opens the `Save File' picker, which
returns a \f[CR]FileSystemFileHandle\f[R] once a file is selected.
From this, a writable stream is created using the
\f[CR]FileSystemFileHandle.createWritable()\f[R] method.
.PP
A text string is then written to the stream, which is subsequently
closed.
.IP
.EX
\f[B]async\f[R] \f[B]function\f[R] saveFile() {
  \f[I]// create a new handle\f[R]
  \f[B]const\f[R] newHandle = \f[B]await\f[R] window.showSaveFilePicker();

  \f[I]// create a FileSystemWritableFileStream to write to\f[R]
  \f[B]const\f[R] writableStream = \f[B]await\f[R] newHandle.createWritable();

  \f[I]// write our file\f[R]
  \f[B]await\f[R] writableStream.write(\[dq]This is my file content\[dq]);

  \f[I]// close the file and write the contents to disk.\f[R]
  \f[B]await\f[R] writableStream.close();
}
.EE
.PP
The following examples show different options that can be passed into
the \f[CR]write()\f[R] method.
.IP
.EX
\f[I]// just pass in the data (no options)\f[R]
writableStream.write(data);

\f[I]// writes the data to the stream from the determined position\f[R]
writableStream.write({ type: \[dq]write\[dq], position, data });

\f[I]// updates the current file cursor offset to the position specified\f[R]
writableStream.write({ type: \[dq]seek\[dq], position });

\f[I]// resizes the file to be size bytes long\f[R]
writableStream.write({ type: \[dq]truncate\[dq], size });
