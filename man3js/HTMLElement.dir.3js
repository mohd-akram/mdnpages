.SH NAME
HTMLElement.dir \- HTMLElement: dir property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]HTMLElement.dir\f[B]\f[R] property gets or sets the text
writing directionality of the content of the current element.
.PP
The text writing directionality of an element is which direction that
text goes (for support of different language systems).
Arabic languages and Hebrew are typical languages using the RTL
directionality.
.PP
An image can have its \f[CR]dir\f[R] property set to
\[lq]\f[CR]rtl\f[R]\[rq] in which case the HTML attributes
\f[CR]title\f[R] and \f[CR]alt\f[R] will be formatted and defined as
\[lq]\f[CR]rtl\f[R]\[rq].
.PP
When a table has its \f[CR]dir\f[R] set to \[lq]\f[CR]rtl\f[R]\[rq], the
column order is arranged from right to left.
.PP
When an element has its dir set to \[lq]\f[CR]auto\f[R]\[rq], the
direction of the element is determined based on its first strong
directionality character, or default to the directionality of its parent
element.

.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R] Browsers might allow users to change the directionality
of \f[CR]<input>\f[R] and \f[CR]<textarea>\f[R]s in order to assist with
authoring content.
Chrome and Safari provide a directionality option in the contextual menu
of input fields while pre\-Chromium Edge uses the key combinations Ctrl
+ Left Shift and Ctrl + Right Shift.
Firefox uses Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + X but does NOT update the
\f[B]\f[CB]dir\f[B]\f[R] attribute value.
