.SH NAME
MediaTrackConstraints.displaySurface \- MediaTrackConstraints:
displaySurface property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[CR]MediaTrackConstraints\f[R] dictionary\[cq]s
\f[B]\f[CB]displaySurface\f[B]\f[R] property is a
\f[CR]ConstrainDOMString\f[R] describing the preferred value for the
\f[CR]displaySurface\f[R] constrainable property.
.PP
This is set by the application to identify to the user agent the type of
display surface (\f[CR]window\f[R], \f[CR]browser\f[R], or
\f[CR]monitor\f[R]) preferred by the application.
It has no effect on what the user can choose to share, but may be used
to present the options in a different order.
.PP
If needed, you can determine whether or not this constraint is supported
by checking the value of
\f[CR]MediaTrackSupportedConstraints.displaySurface\f[R] as returned by
a call to \f[CR]MediaDevices.getSupportedConstraints()\f[R].
However, typically this is unnecessary since browsers will ignore any
constraints they\[cq]re unfamiliar with.
.SH VALUE
A \f[CR]ConstrainDOMString\f[R] which specifies the type of display
surface preferred by the application.
This value \f[I]does not\f[R] add or remove display sources in the
browser\[cq]s user interface, but may reorder them.
You can\[cq]t use this property to limit the user to a subset of the
three display\-surface values \f[CR]window\f[R], \f[CR]browser\f[R], and
\f[CR]monitor\f[R] \[em] but, as you will see below, you can see what
was chosen, and reject it.
.PP
See how constraints are defined.
.RS
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R] You cannot set
\f[CR]monitorTypeSurfaces: \[dq]exclude\[dq]\f[R] at the same time as
\f[CR]displaySurface: \[dq]monitor\[dq]\f[R] as the two settings are
contradictory.
Trying to do so will result in the associated
\f[CR]getDisplayMedia()\f[R] call failing with a \f[CR]TypeError\f[R].
.RE
.SH USAGE NOTES
You can check the setting selected by the user agent after the display
media has been created by \f[CR]getDisplayMedia()\f[R] by calling
\f[CR]getSettings()\f[R] on the display media\[cq]s video
\f[CR]MediaStreamTrack\f[R], then checking the value of the returned
\f[CR]MediaTrackSettings\f[R] object\[cq]s \f[CR]displaySurface\f[R]
object.
.PP
For example, if your app prefers not to share a monitor \[em] meaning
that there\[cq]s possibly a non\-content backdrop being captured \[em]
it can use code similar to this:
.IP
.EX
let mayHaveBackdropFlag = false;
let displaySurface = displayStream
  .getVideoTracks()[0]
  .getSettings().displaySurface;

if (displaySurface === \[dq]monitor\[dq]) {
  mayHaveBackdropFlag = true;
}
.EE
.PP
Following this code, \f[CR]mayHaveBackdrop\f[R] is \f[CR]true\f[R] if
the display surface contained in the stream is of type
\f[CR]monitor\f[R].
Later code can use this flag to determine whether or not to perform
special processing, such as to remove or replace the backdrop, or to
\[lq]cut\[rq] the individual display areas out of the received frames of
video.
.SH EXAMPLES
Here are some example constraints objects for
\f[CR]getDisplayMedia()\f[R] that make use of the
\f[CR]displaySurface\f[R] property.
.IP
.EX
dsConstraints = { displaySurface: \[dq]window\[dq] }; // \[aq]browser\[aq] and \[aq]monitor\[aq] are also possible
applyConstraints(dsConstraints);
// The user still may choose to share the monitor or the browser,
// but we indicated that a window is preferred.
.EE
.PP
In addition, see the Constraint exerciser example that demonstrates how
constraints are used.
