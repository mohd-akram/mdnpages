.SH NAME
TaskSignal \- TaskSignal
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f[B]Note:\f[R] This feature is available in Web Workers.
.PP
The \f[B]\f[CB]TaskSignal\f[B]\f[R] interface of the Prioritized Task
Scheduling API represents a signal object that allows you to communicate
with a prioritized task, and abort it or change the priority (if
required) via a \f[CR]TaskController\f[R] object.
.PP
An object of this type is created, and associated with, a
\f[CR]TaskController\f[R].
The initial priority of the signal may be set by specifying it as an
argument to the \f[CR]TaskController()\f[R] constructor (by default it
is \f[CR]\(dquser\-visible\(dq\f[R]).
The priority can be changed by calling
\f[CR]TaskController.setPriority()\f[R] on the controller.
.PP
The signal may be passed as the \f[CR]options.signal\f[R] argument in
\f[CR]Scheduler.postTask()\f[R], after which it\(cqs associated
controller can be used to abort the task.
If the task priority is mutable, the controller can also be used to
change the task\(cqs priority.
Abortable tasks that do not need the priority to change may instead
specify an \f[CR]AbortSignal\f[R] as the \f[CR]options.signal\f[R]
argument.
.SH INSTANCE PROPERTIES
\f[I]The \f[CI]TaskSignal\f[I] interface also inherits properties from
its parent interface, \f[CI]AbortSignal\f[I].\f[R]
.TP
\f[B]TaskSignal.priority\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
Returns the priority of the signal.
.SH STATIC METHODS
\f[I]The \f[CI]TaskSignal\f[I] interface inherits methods from its
parent interface, \f[CI]AbortSignal\f[I].\f[R]
.TP
\f[B]TaskSignal.any()\f[R] \f[I](experimental)\f[R]
Returns an \f[B]\f[CB]TaskSignal\f[B]\f[R] that aborts when any of the
given abort signals abort.
.SH INSTANCE METHODS
\f[I]The \f[CI]TaskSignal\f[I] interface inherits methods from its
parent interface, \f[CI]AbortSignal\f[I].\f[R]
.SH EVENTS
Listen to these events using \f[CR]addEventListener()\f[R] or by
assigning an event listener to the \f[CR]oneventname\f[R] property of
this interface.
.TP
\f[B]prioritychange\f[R]
Fired when the priority is changed.
This is triggered by calling \f[CR]TaskController.setPriority()\f[R] on
the associated controller.
