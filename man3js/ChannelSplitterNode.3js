.SH NAME
ChannelSplitterNode \- ChannelSplitterNode
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[CR]ChannelSplitterNode\f[R] interface, often used in conjunction
with its opposite, \f[CR]ChannelMergerNode\f[R], separates the different
channels of an audio source into a set of mono outputs.
This is useful for accessing each channel separately, e.g.\ for
performing channel mixing where gain must be separately controlled on
each channel.
[IMAGE: Default channel splitter node with a single input splitting to

Default channel splitter node with a single input splitting to form 6
mono outputs.
.PP
If your \f[CR]ChannelSplitterNode\f[R] always has one single input, the
amount of outputs is defined by a parameter on its constructor and the
call to \f[CR]AudioContext.createChannelSplitter()\f[R].
In the case that no value is given, it will default to \f[CR]6\f[R].
If there are fewer channels in the input than there are outputs,
supernumerary outputs are silent.
Number of inputs
1
Number of outputs
variable; default to 6.
Channel count mode
\[lq]explicit\[rq] Older implementations, as per earlier versions of the
spec use \[lq]max\[rq].
Channel count
Fixed to the number of outputs.
Older implementations, as per earlier versions of the spec use 2 (not
used in the default count mode).
Channel interpretation
\[lq]discrete\[rq]
