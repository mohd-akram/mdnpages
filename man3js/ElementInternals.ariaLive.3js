ElementInternals.ariaLive \- ElementInternals: ariaLive property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]ariaLive\f[B]\f[R] property of the
\f[CR]ElementInternals\f[R] interface reflects the value of the
\f[CR]aria\-live\f[R] attribute, which indicates that an element will be
updated, and describes the types of updates the user agents, assistive
technologies, and user can expect from the live region.

.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R] Setting aria attributes on \f[CR]ElementInternals\f[R]
allows default semantics to be defined on a custom element.
These may be overwritten by author\-defined attributes, but ensure that
default semantics are retained should the author delete those
attributes, or fail to add them at all.
