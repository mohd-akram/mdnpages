.SH NAME
Promise.allSettled \- Promise.allSettled()
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]Promise.allSettled()\f[B]\f[R] static method takes an
iterable of promises as input and returns a single \f[CR]Promise\f[R].
This returned promise fulfills when all of the input\[cq]s promises
settle (including when an empty iterable is passed), with an array of
objects that describe the outcome of each promise.

.SS Parameters
.TP
\f[B]iterable\f[R]
An iterable (such as an \f[CR]Array\f[R]) of promises.
.SS Return value
A \f[CR]Promise\f[R] that is:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Already fulfilled\f[R], if the \f[CR]iterable\f[R] passed is empty.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Asynchronously fulfilled\f[R], when all promises in the given
\f[CR]iterable\f[R] have settled (either fulfilled or rejected).
The fulfillment value is an array of objects, each describing the
outcome of one promise in the \f[CR]iterable\f[R], in the order of the
promises passed, regardless of completion order.
Each outcome object has the following properties:
.RS 2
.TP
\f[B]status\f[R]
A string, either \f[CR]\[dq]fulfilled\[dq]\f[R] or
\f[CR]\[dq]rejected\[dq]\f[R], indicating the eventual state of the
promise.
.TP
\f[B]value\f[R]
Only present if \f[CR]status\f[R] is \f[CR]\[dq]fulfilled\[dq]\f[R].
The value that the promise was fulfilled with.
.TP
\f[B]reason\f[R]
Only present if \f[CR]status\f[R] is \f[CR]\[dq]rejected\[dq]\f[R].
The reason that the promise was rejected with.
.PP
If the \f[CR]iterable\f[R] passed is non\-empty but contains no pending
promises, the returned promise is still asynchronously (instead of
synchronously) fulfilled.
.RE
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f[CR]Promise.allSettled()\f[R] method is one of the promise
concurrency methods.
\f[CR]Promise.allSettled()\f[R] is typically used when you have multiple
asynchronous tasks that are not dependent on one another to complete
successfully, or you\[cq]d always like to know the result of each
promise.
.PP
In comparison, the Promise returned by \f[CR]Promise.all()\f[R] may be
more appropriate if the tasks are dependent on each other, or if
you\[cq]d like to immediately reject upon any of them rejecting.
.SH EXAMPLES
.SS Using Promise.allSettled()
.IP
.EX
Promise.allSettled([
  Promise.resolve(33),
  \f[B]new\f[R] Promise((resolve) \f[B]=>\f[R] setTimeout(() \f[B]=>\f[R] resolve(66), 0)),
  99,
  Promise.reject(\f[B]new\f[R] Error(\[dq]an error\[dq])),
]).then((values) \f[B]=>\f[R] console.log(values));

\f[I]// [\f[R]
\f[I]//   { status: \[aq]fulfilled\[aq], value: 33 },\f[R]
\f[I]//   { status: \[aq]fulfilled\[aq], value: 66 },\f[R]
\f[I]//   { status: \[aq]fulfilled\[aq], value: 99 },\f[R]
\f[I]//   { status: \[aq]rejected\[aq], reason: Error: an error }\f[R]
\f[I]// ]\f[R]
