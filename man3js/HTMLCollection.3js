.SH NAME
HTMLCollection \- HTMLCollection
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]HTMLCollection\f[B]\f[R] interface represents a generic
collection (array\-like object similar to \f[CR]arguments\f[R]) of
elements (in document order) and offers methods and properties for
selecting from the list.
.PP
An \f[CR]HTMLCollection\f[R] in the HTML DOM is live; it is
automatically updated when the underlying document is changed.
For this reason it is a good idea to make a copy (e.g., using
\f[CR]Array.from\f[R]) to iterate over if adding, moving, or removing
nodes.
.PP
This interface is called \f[CR]HTMLCollection\f[R] for historical
reasons, because before the modern DOM, collections implementing this
interface could only have HTML elements as their items.
.PP
This interface was an \c

\ and only continues to be supported to not break code that\[cq]s
already using it.
Modern APIs represent list structures using types based on JavaScript
arrays, thus making many array methods available, and at the same time
imposing additional semantics on their usage (such as making their items
read\-only).
.PP
These historical reasons do not mean that you as a developer should
avoid \f[CR]HTMLCollection\f[R].
You don\[cq]t create \f[CR]HTMLCollection\f[R] objects yourself, but you
get them from APIs such as \f[CR]Document.getElementsByClassName()\f[R],
and these APIs are not deprecated.
However, be careful of the semantic differences from a real array.
.SH INSTANCE PROPERTIES
.TP
\f[B]HTMLCollection.length\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
Returns the number of items in the collection.
.SH INSTANCE METHODS
.TP
\f[B]HTMLCollection.item()\f[R]
Returns the specific element at the given zero\-based \f[CR]index\f[R]
into the list.
Returns \f[CR]null\f[R] if the \f[CR]index\f[R] is out of range.
.RS
.PP
An alternative to accessing \f[CR]collection[i]\f[R] (which instead
returns \f[CR]undefined\f[R] when \f[CR]i\f[R] is out\-of\-bounds).
This is mostly useful for non\-JavaScript DOM implementations.
.RE
.TP
\f[B]HTMLCollection.namedItem()\f[R]
Returns the specific node whose ID or, as a fallback, name matches the
string specified by \f[CR]name\f[R].
Matching by name is only done as a last resort, only in HTML, and only
if the referenced element supports the \f[CR]name\f[R] attribute.
Returns \f[CR]null\f[R] if no node exists by the given name.
.RS
.PP
An alternative to accessing \f[CR]collection[name]\f[R] (which instead
returns \f[CR]undefined\f[R] when \f[CR]name\f[R] does not exist).
This is mostly useful for non\-JavaScript DOM implementations.
.RE
.SH USAGE IN JAVASCRIPT
\f[CR]HTMLCollection\f[R] also exposes its members as properties by name
and index.
HTML IDs may contain \f[CR]:\f[R] and \f[CR].\f[R] as valid characters,
which would necessitate using bracket notation for property access.
Currently, an \f[CR]HTMLCollection\f[R] object does not recognize purely
numeric IDs, which would cause conflict with the array\-style access,
though HTML does permit these.
.PP
For example, assuming there is one \f[CR]<form>\f[R] element in the
document and its \f[CR]id\f[R] is \f[CR]myForm\f[R]:
.IP
.EX
\f[B]let\f[R] elem1, elem2;

\f[I]// document.forms is an HTMLCollection\f[R]

elem1 = document.forms[0];
elem2 = document.forms.item(0);

alert(elem1 === elem2); \f[I]// shows: \[dq]true\[dq]\f[R]

elem1 = document.forms.myForm;
elem2 = document.forms.namedItem(\[dq]myForm\[dq]);

alert(elem1 === elem2); \f[I]// shows: \[dq]true\[dq]\f[R]

elem1 = document.forms[\[dq]named.item.with.periods\[dq]];
