.SH NAME
MediaTrackConstraints.autoGainControl \- MediaTrackConstraints:
autoGainControl property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[CR]MediaTrackConstraints\f[R] dictionary\(cqs
\f[B]\f[CB]autoGainControl\f[B]\f[R] property is a
\f[CR]ConstrainBoolean\f[R] describing the requested or mandatory
constraints placed upon the value of the \f[CR]autoGainControl\f[R]
constrainable property.
.PP
If needed, you can determine whether or not this constraint is supported
by checking the value of
\f[CR]MediaTrackSupportedConstraints.autoGainControl\f[R] as returned by
a call to \f[CR]MediaDevices.getSupportedConstraints()\f[R].
However, typically this is unnecessary since browsers will ignore any
constraints they\(cqre unfamiliar with.
.PP
Automatic gain control is typically a feature provided by microphones,
although it can be provided by other input sources as well.
.SH VALUE
If this value is a simple \f[CR]true\f[R] or \f[CR]false\f[R], the user
agent will attempt to obtain media with automatic gain control enabled
or disabled as specified, if possible, but will not fail if this
can\(cqt be done.
If, instead, the value is given as an object with an \f[CR]exact\f[R]
field, that field\(cqs Boolean value indicates a required setting for
the automatic gain control feature; if it can\(cqt be met, then the
request will result in an error.
.SH EXAMPLES
See the Constraint exerciser example.
