.SH NAME
VideoTrack \- VideoTrack
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]VideoTrack\f[B]\f[R] interface represents a single video
track from a \f[CR]<video>\f[R] element.
.PP
The most common use for accessing a \f[CR]VideoTrack\f[R] object is to
toggle its \f[CR]selected\f[R] property in order to make it the active
video track for its \f[CR]<video>\f[R] element.
.SH INSTANCE PROPERTIES
.TP
\f[B]selected\f[R]
A Boolean value which controls whether or not the video track is active.
Only a single video track can be active at any given time, so setting
this property to \f[CR]true\f[R] for one track while another track is
active will make that other track inactive.
.TP
\f[B]id\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
A string which uniquely identifies the track within the media.
This ID can be used to locate a specific track within a video track list
by calling \f[CR]VideoTrackList.getTrackById()\f[R].
The ID can also be used as the fragment part of the URL if the media
supports seeking by media fragment per the \c
.UR https://www.w3.org/TR/media-frags/
Media Fragments URI specification
.UE \c
\&.
.TP
\f[B]kind\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
A string specifying the category into which the track falls.
For example, the main video track would have a \f[CR]kind\f[R] of
\f[CR]\[dq]main\[dq]\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]label\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
A string providing a human\-readable label for the track.
For example, a track whose \f[CR]kind\f[R] is \f[CR]\[dq]sign\[dq]\f[R]
might have a \f[CR]label\f[R] of
\f[CR]\[dq]A sign\-language interpretation\[dq]\f[R].
This string is empty if no label is provided.
.TP
\f[B]language\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
A string specifying the video track\[cq]s primary language, or an empty
string if unknown.
The language is specified as a BCP 47 (RFC 5646) language code, such as
\f[CR]\[dq]en\-US\[dq]\f[R] or \f[CR]\[dq]pt\-BR\[dq]\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]sourceBuffer\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
The \f[CR]SourceBuffer\f[R] that created the track.
Returns null if the track was not created by a \f[CR]SourceBuffer\f[R]
or the \f[CR]SourceBuffer\f[R] has been removed from the
\f[CR]MediaSource.sourceBuffers\f[R] attribute of its parent media
source.
.SH USAGE NOTES
To get a \f[CR]VideoTrack\f[R] for a given media element, use the
element\[cq]s \f[CR]videoTracks\f[R] property, which returns a
\f[CR]VideoTrackList\f[R] object from which you can get the individual
tracks contained in the media:
.IP
.EX
\f[B]const\f[R] el = document.querySelector(\[dq]video\[dq]);
\f[B]const\f[R] tracks = el.videoTracks;
.EE
.PP
You can then access the media\[cq]s individual tracks using either array
syntax or functions such as \f[CR]forEach()\f[R].
.PP
This first example gets the first video track on the media:
.IP
.EX
\f[B]const\f[R] firstTrack = tracks[0];
.EE
.PP
The next example scans through all of the media\[cq]s video tracks,
activating the first video track that is in the user\[cq]s preferred
language (taken from a variable \f[CR]userLanguage\f[R]).
.IP
.EX
\f[B]for\f[R] (\f[B]const\f[R] track \f[B]of\f[R] tracks) {
  \f[B]if\f[R] (track.language === userLanguage) {
    track.selected = \f[B]true\f[R];
    \f[B]break\f[R];
  }
}
.EE
.PP
The \f[CR]language\f[R] is in standard (RFC 5646) format.
For US English, this would be \f[CR]\[dq]en\-US\[dq]\f[R], for example.
