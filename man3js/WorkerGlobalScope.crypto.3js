.SH NAME
WorkerGlobalScope.crypto \- WorkerGlobalScope: crypto property
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f[B]Note:\f[R] This feature is only available in Web Workers.
.PP
The \f[B]\f[CB]crypto\f[B]\f[R] read\-only property of the
\f[CR]WorkerGlobalScope\f[R] interface returns the \f[CR]Crypto\f[R]
object for this worker.
This object gives workers access to certain cryptographic related
services.
.PP
Although the property itself is read\-only, all of its methods (and the
methods of its child object, \f[CR]SubtleCrypto\f[R]) are not
read\-only, and therefore vulnerable to attack by polyfill.
.PP
Although \f[CR]crypto\f[R] is available on all workers, the returned
\f[CR]Crypto\f[R] object only has one usable feature in insecure
contexts: the \f[CR]getRandomValues()\f[R] method.
In general, you should use this API only in secure contexts.
.SH VALUE
An instance of the \f[CR]Crypto\f[R] interface, providing access to
general\-purpose cryptography and a strong random\-number generator.
.SH EXAMPLES
See the example on the page for \f[CR]Window.crypto\f[R], which uses the
\f[CR]crypto\f[R] property to access the \f[CR]getRandomValues()\f[R]
method.
