.SH NAME
Window.name \- Window: name property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[CR]Window.name\f[R] property gets/sets the name of the
window\[cq]s browsing context.
.SH VALUE
A string.
.SH DESCRIPTION
The name of the window is used primarily for setting targets for
hyperlinks and forms.
Browsing contexts do not need to have names.
.PP
Modern browsers will reset \f[CR]Window.name\f[R] to an empty string if
a tab loads a page from a different domain, and restore the name if the
original page is reloaded (e.g.\ by selecting the \[lq]back\[rq]
button).
This prevents an untrusted page from accessing any information that the
previous page might have stored in the property (potentially the new
page might also modify such data, which might then be read by the
original page if it was reloaded).
.PP
\f[CR]Window.name\f[R] has also been used in some frameworks for
providing cross\-domain messaging as a more secure alternative to JSONP.
Modern web applications hosting sensitive data should, however, not rely
on \f[CR]window.name\f[R] for cross\-domain messaging \[em] that is not
its intended purpose and there are safer/better ways of sharing
information between windows.
\f[CR]Window.postMessage()\f[R] is the recommended mechanism.
.RS
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R] \f[CR]window.name\f[R] converts all stored values to
their string representations using the \f[CR]toString\f[R] method.
