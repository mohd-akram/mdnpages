.SH NAME
NetworkInformation \- NetworkInformation
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f[B]Note:\f[R] This feature is available in Web Workers.
.PP
The \f[B]\f[CB]NetworkInformation\f[B]\f[R] interface of the Network
Information API provides information about the connection a device is
using to communicate with the network and provides a means for scripts
to be notified if the connection type changes.
The \f[CR]NetworkInformation\f[R] interface cannot be instantiated.
It is instead accessed through the \f[CR]connection\f[R] property of the
\f[CR]Navigator\f[R] interface or the \f[CR]WorkerNavigator\f[R]
interface.
.SH INSTANCE PROPERTIES
\f[I]This interface also inherits properties of its parent,
\f[CI]EventTarget\f[I].\f[R]
.TP
\f[B]NetworkInformation.downlink\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
Returns the effective bandwidth estimate in megabits per second, rounded
to the nearest multiple of 25 kilobits per seconds.
.TP
\f[B]NetworkInformation.downlinkMax\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R] \f[I](experimental)\f[R]
Returns the maximum downlink speed, in megabits per second (Mbps), for
the underlying connection technology.
.TP
\f[B]NetworkInformation.effectiveType\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
Returns the effective type of the connection meaning one of `slow\-2g',
`2g', `3g', or `4g'.
This value is determined using a combination of recently observed
round\-trip time and downlink values.
.TP
\f[B]NetworkInformation.rtt\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
Returns the estimated effective round\-trip time of the current
connection, rounded to the nearest multiple of 25 milliseconds.
.TP
\f[B]NetworkInformation.saveData\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
Returns \f[CR]true\f[R] if the user has set a reduced data usage option
on the user agent.
.TP
\f[B]NetworkInformation.type\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R] \f[I](experimental)\f[R]
Returns the type of connection a device is using to communicate with the
network.
It will be one of the following values:

.SH INSTANCE METHODS
\f[I]This interface also inherits methods of its parent,

.SH EVENTS
.TP
\f[B]change\f[R]
The event that\[cq]s fired when connection information changes.
