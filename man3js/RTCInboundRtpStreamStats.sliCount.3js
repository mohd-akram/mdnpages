.SH NAME
RTCInboundRtpStreamStats.sliCount \- RTCInboundRtpStreamStats: sliCount
property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]sliCount\f[B]\f[R] property of the
\f[CR]RTCInboundRtpStreamStats\f[R] dictionary indicates how many
\f[B]Slice Loss Indication\f[R] (\f[B]SLI\f[R]) packets the
\f[CR]RTCRtpReceiver\f[R] for which this object provides statistics sent
to the remote \f[CR]RTCRtpSender\f[R].
.PP
An SLI packet is used by a decoder to let the encoder know that it\(cqs
detected corruption of one or more consecutive macroblocks (in scan
order) in the received media.
.PP
In general, what\(cqs usually of interest is that the higher this number
is, the more the stream data is becoming corrupted between the sender
and the receiver, requiring resends or dropping frames.
.SH VALUE
An unsigned integer indicating the number of SLI packets this receiver
sent to the remote sender due to lost runs of macroblocks.
A high value of \f[CR]sliCount\f[R] may be an indication of an
unreliable network.
.PP
This is a very technical part of how video codecs work.
For details, see RFC 4585: 6.3.2.

\f[B]Note:\f[R] This value is only present for video media.
