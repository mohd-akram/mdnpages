.SH SYNOPSIS
\f[B]Secure context:\f[R] This feature is available only in secure
contexts (HTTPS).
.PP
The \f[B]\f[CB]WakeLock\f[B]\f[R] interface of the Screen Wake Lock API
can be used to request a lock that prevents device screens from dimming
or locking when an application needs to keep running.
.PP
This interface, and hence the system wake lock, is exposed through the
\f[CR]Navigator.wakeLock\f[R] property.
.SH INSTANCE METHODS
.TP

\f[CR]WakeLockSentinel\f[R] object if the screen wake lock is granted.

\f[CR]WakeLockSentinel\f[R] object, and continues if the request is
granted.
.PP
The \f[CR]WakeLock.request()\f[R] method is wrapped in a
\f[CR]try...catch\f[R] statement to catch cases when the promise might
be rejected rejected, such as due to low device power.

} \f[B]catch\f[R] (err) {
  \f[I]// the wake lock request fails \- usually system related, such being low on battery\f[R]
