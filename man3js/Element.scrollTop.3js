.SH NAME
Element.scrollTop \- Element: scrollTop property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]Element.scrollTop\f[B]\f[R] property gets or sets the
number of pixels by which an element\[cq]s content is scrolled from its
top edge.
This value is subpixel precise in modern browsers, meaning that it
isn\[cq]t necessarily a whole number.
.SH VALUE
A double\-precision floating\-point value indicating the number of
pixels by which the element is currently scrolled vertically from the
origin, where a positive value means the element is scrolled down (to
reveal more content to the bottom).
If the element isn\[cq]t scrolled at all up or down, then
\f[CR]scrollTop\f[R] is 0.
If the document is not the active document, the returned value is 0.
If the document is rendered on a subpixel\-precise device, then the
returned value is also subpixel\-precise and may contain a decimal
component.
.PP
It\[cq]s possible for \f[CR]scrollTop\f[R] to be negative if the element
can be scrolled up from the initial containing block.
For example, if the element\[cq]s \f[CR]flex\-direction\f[R] is
\f[CR]column\-reverse\f[R] and content grows upwards, then
\f[CR]scrollTop\f[R] is \f[CR]0\f[R] when the scrollbar is at its
bottommost position (at the start of the scrolled content), and then
increasingly negative as you scroll towards the end of the content.
.PP
Safari responds to overscrolling by updating \f[CR]scrollTop\f[R] beyond
the maximum scroll position (unless the default \[lq]bounce\[rq] effect
is disabled, such as by setting \f[CR]overscroll\-behavior\f[R] to
\f[CR]none\f[R]), while Chrome and Firefox do not.
For example, \f[CR]scrollTop\f[R] may be negative on Safari just by
continuing to scroll up when the element is already at the top.
.PP
The \f[CR]scrollTop\f[R] property can be set, which causes the element
to scroll to the specified vertical position, in the same way as using
\f[CR]Element.scroll()\f[R] with \f[CR]behavior: \[dq]auto\[dq]\f[R].

    Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the western
    spiral arm of the Galaxy lies a small unregarded yellow sun. Orbiting this
    at a distance of roughly ninety\-two million miles is an utterly
    insignificant little blue green planet whose ape\-descended life forms are so
    amazingly primitive that they still think digital watches are a pretty neat
    idea.
