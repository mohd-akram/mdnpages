.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]HTMLAudioElement\f[B]\f[R] interface provides access to
the properties of \f[CR]<audio>\f[R] elements, as well as methods to
manipulate them.
.PP
This element is based on, and inherits properties and methods from, the
\f[CR]HTMLMediaElement\f[R] interface.
.SH CONSTRUCTOR
.TP
\f[B]Audio()\f[R]
Creates and returns a new \f[CR]HTMLAudioElement\f[R] object, optionally
starting the process of loading an audio file into it if the file URL is
given.
.SH INSTANCE PROPERTIES
\f[I]No specific properties; inherits properties from its parent,
\f[CI]HTMLMediaElement\f[I], and from \f[CI]HTMLElement\f[I].\f[R]
.SH INSTANCE METHODS
\f[I]Inherits methods from its parent, \f[CI]HTMLMediaElement\f[I], and
from \f[CI]HTMLElement\f[I].
It offers no methods of its own.\f[R]
.SH EXAMPLES
.SS Basic usage
You can create a \f[CR]HTMLAudioElement\f[R] entirely with JavaScript
using the \f[CR]Audio()\f[R] constructor:
.IP
.EX
const audioElement = new Audio(\[dq]car_horn.wav\[dq]);
.EE
.PP
then you can invoke the \f[CR]play()\f[R] method on the element
.IP
.EX
audioElement.play();
.EE
.RS
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R] A common gotcha is trying to play an audio element
immediately on page load.
Modern browser\[cq]s default autoplay policy will block that from
happening.

.PP
Some of the more commonly used properties of the audio element include
\f[CR]src\f[R], \f[CR]currentTime\f[R], \f[CR]duration\f[R],
\f[CR]paused\f[R], \f[CR]muted\f[R], and \f[CR]volume\f[R].
This snippet copies the audio file\[cq]s duration to a variable:
.IP
.EX
const audioElement = new Audio(\[dq]car_horn.wav\[dq]);
audioElement.addEventListener(\[dq]loadeddata\[dq], () => {
  let duration = audioElement.duration;
  // The duration variable now holds the duration (in seconds) of the audio clip
});
.EE
.SH EVENTS
\f[I]Inherits methods from its parent, \f[CI]HTMLMediaElement\f[I], and
from its ancestor \f[CI]HTMLElement\f[I].\f[R] Listen to events using
\f[CR]addEventListener()\f[R] or by assigning an event listener to the
\f[CR]oneventname\f[R] property of this interface.
