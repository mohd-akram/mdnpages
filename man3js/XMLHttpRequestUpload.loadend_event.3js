.SH NAME
XMLHttpRequestUpload.loadend_event \- XMLHttpRequestUpload: loadend
event
.SH SYNOPSIS
This feature is available in Web Workers, except for Service Workers.
.PP
The \f[B]\f[CB]loadend\f[B]\f[R] event is fired when a request has
completed, whether successfully (after \f[CR]load\f[R]) or
unsuccessfully (after \f[CR]abort\f[R] or \f[CR]error\f[R]).
.PP
The \f[CR]loadend\f[R] event is also sent when the request has been
interrupted (by a \f[CR]timeout\f[R], an \f[CR]abort\f[R], or an
\f[CR]error\f[R]).
In such cases, both the \f[CR]loaded\f[R] and \f[CR]total\f[R] value of
the event will be 0.
.SH SYNTAX
Use the event name in methods like \f[CR]addEventListener()\f[R], or set
an event handler property.
.IP
.EX
addEventListener(\[dq]loadend\[dq], (event) \f[B]=>\f[R] {});

onloadend = (event) \f[B]=>\f[R] {};

.SH EVENT TYPE
A \f[CR]ProgressEvent\f[R].
Inherits from \f[CR]Event\f[R].
.SH EVENT PROPERTIES
\f[I]In addition to the properties listed below, properties from the
parent interface, \f[CI]Event\f[I], are available.\f[R]
.TP
\f[B]lengthComputable\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
A boolean flag indicating if the total work to be done, and the amount
of work already done, by the underlying process is calculable.
In other words, it tells if the progress is measurable or not.
.TP
\f[B]loaded\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
A 64\-bit unsigned integer value indicating the amount of work already
performed by the underlying process.
The ratio of work done can be calculated by dividing \f[CR]total\f[R] by
the value of this property.
When downloading a resource using HTTP, this only counts the body of the
HTTP message, and doesn\[cq]t include headers and other overhead.
.TP
\f[B]total\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
A 64\-bit unsigned integer representing the total amount of work that
the underlying process is in the progress of performing.
When downloading a resource using HTTP, this is the
\f[CR]Content\-Length\f[R] (the size of the body of the message), and
doesn\[cq]t include the headers and other overhead.
.SH EXAMPLES
.SH USING THE \f[CR]loadend\f[R] EVENT
You can use the \f[CR]loadend\f[R] event to detect the (successful or
not) termination of an upload.
For a complete code example that uploads a file and displays a progress
bar, see the main \f[CR]XMLHttpRequestUpload\f[R] page.
.IP
.EX
\f[I]// When the upload is finished, we hide the progress bar.\f[R]
xhr.upload.addEventListener(\[dq]loadend\[dq], (event) \f[B]=>\f[R] {
  progressBar.classList.remove(\[dq]visible\[dq]);
  \f[B]if\f[R] (event.loaded !== 0) {
    \f[I]// Successful termination\f[R]
    log.textContent = \[dq]Upload finished.\[dq];
  }
  abortButton.disabled = \f[B]true\f[R];
});
