RTCDataChannel.label \- RTCDataChannel: label property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The read\-only \f[CR]RTCDataChannel\f[R] property
\f[B]\f[CB]label\f[B]\f[R] returns a string containing a name describing
the data channel.
These labels are not required to be unique.
.PP
You may use the label as you wish; you could use it to identify all the
channels that are being used for the same purpose, by giving them all
the same name.
Or you could give each channel a unique label for tracking purposes.
It\[cq]s entirely up to the design decisions made when building your
site or app.
.PP
A unique ID can be found in the \f[CR]id\f[R] property.
.RS

\f[B]Note:\f[R] A data channel\[cq]s label is set when the channel is
created by calling \f[CR]RTCPeerConnection.createDataChannel()\f[R].
It cannot be changed after that.

then, some time later, sets the content of a UI element to display the
channel\[cq]s name.
