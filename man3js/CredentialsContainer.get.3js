.SH NAME
CredentialsContainer.get \- CredentialsContainer: get() method
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]get()\f[B]\f[R] method of the
\f[CR]CredentialsContainer\f[R] interface returns a \f[CR]Promise\f[R]
that fulfills with a single credential instance that matches the
provided parameters, which the browser can then use to authenticate with
a relying party.
This is used by several different credential\-related APIs with
significantly different purposes:
.IP \[bu] 2
The Credential Management API uses \f[CR]get()\f[R] to authenticate
using basic federated credentials or username/password credentials.
.IP \[bu] 2
The Web Authentication API uses \f[CR]get()\f[R] to authenticate or
provide additional factors during MFA with public key credentials (based
on asymmetric cryptography).
.IP \[bu] 2
The Federated Credential Management (FedCM) API uses \f[CR]get()\f[R] to
authenticate with federated identity providers (IdPs).
.IP \[bu] 2
The WebOTP API uses \f[CR]get()\f[R] to request retrieval of a one\-time
password (OTP) from a specially\-formatted SMS message sent by an app
server.
.PP
The below reference page starts with a syntax section that explains the
general method call structure and parameters that apply to all the
different APIs.
After that, it is split into separate sections providing parameters,
return values, and examples specific to each API.

.SS Parameters
.TP
\f[B]options\f[R] \f[I](optional)\f[R]
An object that contains options for the request.
The options include criteria that the credentials are required or
allowed to have, and options for interacting with the user.
It can contain the following properties:
.RS
.TP
\[lq]Credential type\[rq]
An object or boolean defining the type of credential being requested
\[em] this can be one of one of:
.RS
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]federated\f[R]: An object containing requirements for a requested
credential from a federated identify provider.
Bear in mind that the Federated Credential Management API (the
\f[CR]identity\f[R] credential type) supersedes this credential type.
See the Credential Management API section below for more details.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]password\f[R]: A boolean value indicating that a password
credential is being requested.
See the Credential Management API section below for more details.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]identity\f[R]: An object containing details of federated identity
providers (IdPs) that a relying party (RP) website can use for purposes
such as signing in or signing up on a website.
It causes the \f[CR]get()\f[R] call to initiate a request for a user to
sign in to an RP with an IdP.
See the Federated Credential Management API section below for more
details.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]otp\f[R]: An object containing transport type hints.
Causes the \f[CR]get()\f[R] call to initiate a request for the retrieval
of an OTP.
See the WebOTP API section below for more details.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]publicKey\f[R]: An object containing requirements for returned
public key credentials.
Causes the \f[CR]get()\f[R] call to use an existing set of public key
credentials to authenticate to a relying party.
See the Web Authentication API section below for more details.
.RE
.TP
\f[B]mediation\f[R] \f[I](optional)\f[R]
A string indicating whether the user will be required to login for every
visit to a client app.
The value can be one of the following:
.RS
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\[dq]conditional\[dq]\f[R]: Discovered credentials are presented
to the user in a non\-modal dialog box along with an indication of the
origin requesting credentials.
In practice, this means autofilling available credentials; see \c
.UR https://web.dev/articles/passkey-form-autofill
Sign in with a passkey through form autofill
.UE \c
\ for more details of how this is used;
\f[CR]PublicKeyCredential.isConditionalMediationAvailable()\f[R] also
provides some useful information.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\[dq]optional\[dq]\f[R]: If credentials can be handed over for a
given operation without user mediation, they will be.
If user mediation is required, then the user agent will ask the user to
authenticate.
This value is intended for situations where you have reasonable
confidence that a user won\[cq]t be surprised or confused at seeing a
login dialog box \[em] for example on a site that doesn\[cq]t
automatically log users in, when a user has just clicked a
\[lq]Login/Signup\[rq] button.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\[dq]required\[dq]\f[R]: The user will always be asked to
authenticate, even if prevent silent access (see
\f[CR]CredentialsContainer.preventSilentAccess()\f[R]) is set to
\f[CR]false\f[R].
This value is intended for situations where you want to force user
authentication \[em] for example if you want a user to reauthenticate
when a sensitive operation is being performed (like confirming a credit
card payment), or when switching users.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\[dq]silent\[dq]\f[R]: The user will not be asked to authenticate.
The user agent will automatically log the user in if possible; if
consent is required, the promise will fulfill with \f[CR]null\f[R].
This value is intended for situations where you would want to
automatically sign a user in upon visiting a web app if possible, but if
not, you don\[cq]t want to present them with a confusing login dialog
box.
Instead, you\[cq]d want to wait for them to explicitly click a
\[lq]Login/Signup\[rq] button.
.PP
If \f[CR]mediation\f[R] is omitted, it will default to
\f[CR]\[dq]optional\[dq]\f[R].
.RE
.TP
\f[B]signal\f[R] \f[I](optional)\f[R]
An \f[CR]AbortSignal\f[R] object instance that allows an ongoing
\f[CR]get()\f[R] operation to be aborted.
An aborted operation may complete normally (generally if the abort was
received after the operation finished) or reject with an
\[lq]\f[CR]AbortError\f[R]\[rq] \f[CR]DOMException\f[R].
.RE
.SH CREDENTIAL MANAGEMENT API
The Credential Management API lets a website store and retrieve password
and federated credentials.
These capabilities allow users to sign in without typing passwords, see
the federated account they used to sign in to a site, and resume a
session without the explicit sign\-in flow of an expired session.
.SS \f[CR]federated\f[R] object structure
\f[CR]federated\f[R] will contain the following properties:
.TP
\f[B]protocols\f[R]
An array of strings representing the protocols of the requested
credentials\[cq] federated identity providers (for example,
\f[CR]\[dq]openidconnect\[dq]\f[R]).
.TP
\f[B]providers\f[R]
An array of strings representing the credentials\[cq] federated identity
providers (for example \f[CR]\[dq]https://www.facebook.com\[dq]\f[R] or
\f[CR]\[dq]https://accounts.google.com\[dq]\f[R]).
.SS \f[CR]password\f[R] boolean value
\f[CR]password\f[R] is a single boolean value.
If set to \f[CR]true\f[R], it indicates that the requested credential is
a password credential.
.SS Return value
A \f[CR]Promise\f[R] that resolves with a \f[CR]Credential\f[R] instance
matching the provided parameters:
.IP \[bu] 2
If the provided credential type was a \f[CR]federated\f[R] object, the
returned instance will be a \f[CR]FederatedCredential\f[R].
.IP \[bu] 2
If the provided credential type was a \f[CR]password\f[R] boolean value
of \f[CR]true\f[R], the returned instance will be a

.SH FEDERATED CREDENTIAL MANAGEMENT API
The Federated Credential Management (FedCM) API provides a standard
mechanism for identity providers (IdPs) to enable identity federation
services in a privacy\-preserving way without relying on third\-party
cookies and redirects.
This includes a JavaScript API that enables the use of federated
authentication for purposes such as signing in or signing up to a
website.

.SS \f[CR]identity\f[R] object structure
\f[CR]identity\f[R] can contain the following properties:
.TP
\f[B]context\f[R] \f[I](optional)\f[R]
An enumerated value specifying the context in which the user is
authenticating with FedCM.
The browser uses this value to vary the text in its FedCM UI to better
suit the context.
Possible values are:
.RS
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]continue\f[R]: Suitable for situations where the user is choosing
an identity to continue to the next page in the flow, which requires a
sign\-in.
Browsers will provide a text string similar to \[lq]Continue to
<page\-origin> with <IdP>\[rq].
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]signin\f[R]: Suitable for general situations where the user is
signing in with an IdP account they\[cq]ve already used on this origin.
Browsers will provide a text string similar to \[lq]Sign in to
<page\-origin> with <IdP>\[rq].
This is the default value.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]signup\f[R]: An option for situations where the user is signing in
to the origin with a new IdP account they\[cq]ve not used here before.
Browsers will provide a text string similar to \[lq]Sign up to
<page\-origin> with <IdP>\[rq].
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]use\f[R]: Suitable for situations where a different action, such
as validating a payment, is being performed.

.RE
.TP
\f[B]providers\f[R]
An array of objects specifying details of the different IdPs to be used
to sign in.
Each object can contain the following properties:
.RS
.TP
\f[B]configURL\f[R]
A string specifying the URL of the IdP\[cq]s config file.
See the Provide a config file section on the \f[I]FedCM API\f[R] landing
page for more information.
.TP
\f[B]clientId\f[R]
A string specifying the RP\[cq]s client identifier.
This information is issued by the IdP to the RP in a separate process
that is specific to the IdP.
.TP
\f[B]loginHint\f[R] \f[I](optional)\f[R]
A string providing a hint about the account option(s) the browser should
provide for the user to sign in with.
This is useful in cases where the user has already signed in and the
site asks them to reauthenticate.
Otherwise, the reauthentication process can be confusing when a user has
multiple accounts and can\[cq]t remember which one they used to sign in
previously.
The value for the \f[CR]loginHint\f[R] property can be taken from the
user\[cq]s previous sign\-in, and is matched against the
\f[CR]login_hints\f[R] values provided by the IdP in the array of user
information returned from the accounts list endpoint.
.TP
\f[B]nonce\f[R] \f[I](optional)\f[R]
A random string that can be included to ensure the response is issued
specifically for this request and prevent replay attacks.
.RE
.SS Return value
A \f[CR]Promise\f[R] that resolves with an \f[CR]IdentityCredential\f[R]

.SS Examples
Relying parties can call \f[CR]get()\f[R] with the \f[CR]identity\f[R]
option to make a request for users to login to the relying party via an
identity provider (IdP), using identity federation.
A typical request would look like this:
.IP
.EX
async function signIn() {
  const identityCredential = await navigator.credentials.get({
    identity: {
      providers: [
        {
          configURL: \[dq]https://accounts.idp.example/config.json\[dq],
          clientId: \[dq]********\[dq],
          nonce: \[dq]******\[dq],
        },
      ],
    },
  });
}
.EE
.PP
Check out Federated Credential Management (FedCM) API for more details
on how this works.
This call will start off the sign\-in flow described in FedCM sign\-in
flow.
.PP
A similar call including the \f[CR]context\f[R] and \f[CR]loginHint\f[R]
extensions would look like so:
.IP
.EX
async function signIn() {
  const identityCredential = await navigator.credentials.get({
    identity: {
      context: \[dq]signup\[dq],
      providers: [

          loginHint: \[dq]user1\[at]example.com\[dq],
        },
      ],
    },
  });
}
.EE
.RS
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R] Once a user has already signed in with an IdP, the IdP
can call the static \f[CR]IdentityProvider.getUserInfo()\f[R] method on
the user\[cq]s return to retrieve their details.
\f[CR]getUserInfo()\f[R] must be called from within an IdP\-origin
\f[CR]<iframe>\f[R] to ensure that RP scripts cannot access the data.
This information can then be used to display a personalized welcome
message and sign\-in button.
This approach is already common on sites that use identity federation
for sign\-in; however, \f[CR]getUserInfo()\f[R] offers a way to achieve
this without relying on third\-party cookies.
.RE
.SH WEBOTP API
The WebOTP API lets a web client request an OTP from an SMS sent by the

This capability is intended to streamline usage of OTPs in web apps, for
example when using phone numbers as additional factors in sign\-in
flows.
The OTP is retrieved from the SMS and can be set as a verification input
value automatically after the user gives consent, avoiding the need for
the user to manually go into their SMS app and copy and paste it.

A successful \f[CR]get()\f[R] call returns a promise that resolves with
a \f[CR]PublicKeyCredential\f[R] object instance, representing a public
key credential previously created via a WebAuthn \f[CR]create()\f[R]
that has now been used to authenticate a user.
Its \f[CR]PublicKeyCredential.response\f[R] property contains an
\f[CR]AuthenticatorAssertionResponse\f[R] object providing access to
several useful pieces of information including the authenticator data,
signature, and user handle.

Some of this data will need to be stored on the server \[em] for example
the \f[CR]signature\f[R] to provide proof that authenticator possesses
the genuine private key used to create the credential, and the
\f[CR]userHandle\f[R] to link the user with the credential, sign in
attempt, and other data.
