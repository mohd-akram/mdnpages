.SH NAME
RTCDTMFSender \- RTCDTMFSender
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]RTCDTMFSender\f[B]\f[R] interface provides a mechanism
for transmitting DTMF codes on a WebRTC \f[CR]RTCPeerConnection\f[R].
You gain access to the connection\[cq]s \f[CR]RTCDTMFSender\f[R] through
the \f[CR]RTCRtpSender.dtmf\f[R] property on the audio track you wish to
send DTMF with.
.PP
The primary purpose for WebRTC\[cq]s DTMF support is to allow
WebRTC\-based communication clients to be connected to a \c
.UR https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_switched_telephone_network
public\-switched telephone network (PSTN)
.UE \c
\ or other legacy telephone service, including extant voice over IP
(VoIP) services.
For that reason, DTMF can\[cq]t be used between two WebRTC\-based
devices, because there is no mechanism provided by WebRTC for receiving
DTMF codes.
.SH INSTANCE PROPERTIES
.TP
\f[B]RTCDTMFSender.canInsertDTMF\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
A boolean value which is \f[CR]true\f[R] if the \f[CR]RTCDTMFSender\f[R]
is capable of sending DTMF tones, or \f[CR]false\f[R] if it is not.
.TP
\f[B]RTCDTMFSender.toneBuffer\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
A string which contains the list of DTMF tones currently in the queue to
be transmitted (tones which have already been played are no longer
included in the string).
See \f[CR]toneBuffer\f[R] for details on the format of the tone buffer.
.SH INSTANCE METHODS
.TP
\f[B]RTCDTMFSender.insertDTMF()\f[R]
Given a string describing a set of DTMF codes and, optionally, the
duration of and inter\-tone gap between the tones,
\f[CR]insertDTMF()\f[R] starts sending the specified tones.
Calling \f[CR]insertDTMF()\f[R] replaces any already\-pending tones from
the \f[CR]toneBuffer\f[R].
You can abort sending queued tones by specifying an empty string
(\f[CR]\[dq]\[dq]\f[R]) as the set of tones to play.
.SH EVENTS
Listen to these events using \f[CR]addEventListener()\f[R] or by
assigning an event listener to the \f[CR]oneventname\f[R] property of
this interface.
.TP
\f[B]tonechange\f[R]
The \f[CR]tonechange\f[R] event is sent to the \f[CR]RTCDTMFSender\f[R]
instance\[cq]s event handler to indicate that a tone has either started
or stopped playing.
.SH EXAMPLE
See the article Using DTMF with WebRTC for a full example.
