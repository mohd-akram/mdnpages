.SH SYNOPSIS
\f[B]Secure context:\f[R] This feature is available only in secure
contexts (HTTPS).
.PP
The read\-only \f[B]\f[CB]methodName\f[B]\f[R] property of the
\f[CR]PaymentMethodChangeEvent\f[R] interface is a string which uniquely
identifies the payment handler currently selected by the user.
The payment handler may be a payment technology, such as Apple Pay or
Android Pay, and each payment handler may support multiple payment
methods; changes to the payment method within the payment handler are
described by the \f[CR]PaymentMethodChangeEvent\f[R].
.SH VALUE
A string which uniquely identifies the currently\-selected payment
handler.
This may be a string chosen from the list of standardized payment method
identifiers, or a URL used by the payment processing service.
See Payment method identifiers for more information.
.PP
The default value is the empty string, \f[CR]\(dq\(dq\f[R].
.SH EXAMPLES
This example uses the \f[CR]paymentmethodchange\f[R] event to watch for
changes to the payment method selected for Apple Pay, in order to
compute a discount if the user chooses to use a Visa card as their
payment method.

        \f[B]const\f[R] discount = calculateDiscount(ev.methodDetails);
        Object.assign(newStuff, discount);

.PP
Note that the \f[CR]methodDetails\f[R] property is being used by the
\f[CR]calculateDiscount()\f[R] function to compute any payment discount,
then \f[CR]updateWith()\f[R] is called to update the event with the
computed update.
