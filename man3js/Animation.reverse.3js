backwards.

Growing/Shrinking Alice Game
.UE \c
\ example, clicking or tapping the bottle causes Alice\[cq]s growing
animation (\f[CR]aliceChange\f[R]) to play backwards, causing her to get
smaller.
It is done by setting \f[CR]aliceChange\f[R]\[cq]s
\f[CR]Animation.playbackRate\f[R] to \f[CR]\-1\f[R] like so:
.IP
.EX
\f[B]const\f[R] shrinkAlice = () \f[B]=>\f[R] {
  \f[I]// play Alice\[aq]s animation in reverse\f[R]
  aliceChange.playbackRate = \-1;
  aliceChange.play();

  \f[I]// play the bottle\[aq]s animation\f[R]
  drinking.play();
};
.EE
.PP
But it could also have been done by calling \f[CR]reverse()\f[R] on
\f[CR]aliceChange\f[R] like so:
.IP
.EX
\f[B]const\f[R] shrinkAlice = () \f[B]=>\f[R] {
  \f[I]// play Alice\[aq]s animation in reverse\f[R]
  aliceChange.reverse();

  \f[I]// play the bottle\[aq]s animation\f[R]
  drinking.play();
};
