.SH NAME
MediaSource.canConstructInDedicatedWorker_static \- MediaSource:
canConstructInDedicatedWorker static property
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f[B]Note:\f[R] This feature is available in Dedicated Web Workers.
.PP
The \f[B]\f[CB]canConstructInDedicatedWorker\f[B]\f[R] static property
of the \f[CR]MediaSource\f[R] interface returns \f[CR]true\f[R] if
\f[CR]MediaSource\f[R] worker support is implemented, providing a
low\-latency feature detection mechanism.
.PP
If this were not available, the alternative would be a much higher
latency approach such as attempting the creation of a
\f[CR]MediaSource\f[R] object from a dedicated worker and transferring
the result back to the main thread.
.SH VALUE
A boolean.
Returns \f[CR]true\f[R] if \f[CR]MediaSource\f[R] worker support is
implemented, or \f[CR]false\f[R] otherwise.
