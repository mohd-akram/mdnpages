.SH NAME
MediaTrackConstraints.noiseSuppression \- MediaTrackConstraints:
noiseSuppression property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[CR]MediaTrackConstraints\f[R] dictionary\[cq]s
\f[B]\f[CB]noiseSuppression\f[B]\f[R] property is a
\f[CR]ConstrainBoolean\f[R] describing the requested or mandatory
constraints placed upon the value of the \f[CR]noiseSuppression\f[R]
constrainable property.
.PP
If needed, you can determine whether or not this constraint is supported
by checking the value of
\f[CR]MediaTrackSupportedConstraints.noiseSuppression\f[R] as returned
by a call to \f[CR]MediaDevices.getSupportedConstraints()\f[R].
However, typically this is unnecessary since browsers will ignore any
constraints they\[cq]re unfamiliar with.
.PP
Noise suppression is typically provided by microphones, although it can
be provided by other input sources as well.
.SH VALUE
If this value is a simple \f[CR]true\f[R] or \f[CR]false\f[R], the user
agent will attempt to obtain media with noise suppression enabled or
disabled as specified, if possible, but will not fail if this can\[cq]t
be done.
If, instead, the value is given as an object with an \f[CR]exact\f[R]
field, that field\[cq]s Boolean value indicates a required setting for
the noise suppression feature; if it can\[cq]t be met, then the request
will result in an error.
.SH EXAMPLES
See the Constraint exerciser example.
