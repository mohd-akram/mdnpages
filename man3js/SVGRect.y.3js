SVGRect.y \- SVGRect: y property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]y\f[B]\f[R] property of the \f[CR]SVGRect\f[R] interface
is an alias for the \f[CR]DOMRect.y\f[R] property.
It describes the vertical coordinate of the position of the element.
It reflects the SVG element\(cqs \f[CR]y\f[R] attribute and the CSS
\f[CR]y\f[R] property.

A \f[CR]<coordinate>\f[R] is a length in the user coordinate system that
is the given distance from the origin of the user coordinate system
along the relevant axis (the y\-axis for Y coordinates, the x\-axis for
X coordinates).
Its syntax is the same as that for \f[CR]<length>\f[R].
