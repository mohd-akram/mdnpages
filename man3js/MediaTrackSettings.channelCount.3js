.SH NAME
MediaTrackSettings.channelCount \- MediaTrackSettings: channelCount
property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[CR]MediaTrackSettings\f[R] dictionary\[cq]s
\f[B]\f[CB]channelCount\f[B]\f[R] property is an integer indicating how
many audio channels the \f[CR]MediaStreamTrack\f[R] is currently
configured to have.
This lets you determine what value was selected to comply with your
specified constraints for this property\[cq]s value as described in the
\f[CR]MediaTrackConstraints.channelCount\f[R] property you provided when
calling either \f[CR]getUserMedia()\f[R] or
\f[CR]MediaStreamTrack.applyConstraints()\f[R].
.PP
If needed, you can determine whether or not this constraint is supported
by checking the value of
\f[CR]MediaTrackSupportedConstraints.channelCount\f[R] as returned by a
call to \f[CR]MediaDevices.getSupportedConstraints()\f[R].
However, typically this is unnecessary since browsers will ignore any
constraints they\[cq]re unfamiliar with.
.SH VALUE
An integer value indicating the number of audio channels on the track.
A value of 1 indicates monaural sound, 2 means stereo, and so forth.
.SH EXAMPLES
See the Constraint exerciser example.
