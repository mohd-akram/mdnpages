corresponds to the numeric keypad.

\f[B]Note:\f[R] When NumLock is locked, Firefox always returns
\f[CR]DOM_KEY_LOCATION_NUMPAD\f[R] for the keys on the numeric pad.
Otherwise, when NumLock is unlocked and the keyboard actually has a
numeric keypad, Firefox always returns
\f[CR]DOM_KEY_LOCATION_NUMPAD\f[R] too.
On the other hand, if the keyboard doesn\[aq]t have a keypad, such as on
a notebook computer, some keys become Numpad only when NumLock is
locked.
When such keys fires key events, the location attribute value depends on
the key.
That is, it must not be \f[CR]DOM_KEY_LOCATION_NUMPAD\f[R].
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R] NumLock key\[aq]s key events indicate
\f[CR]DOM_KEY_LOCATION_STANDARD\f[R] both on Firefox and Internet
