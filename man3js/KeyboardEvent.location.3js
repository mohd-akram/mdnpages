Description

location on the keyboard.

      <p>
        <strong>Note:</strong> When <kbd>NumLock</kbd> is locked, Firefox
        always returns <code>DOM_KEY_LOCATION_NUMPAD</code> for the keys on
        the numeric pad. Otherwise, when <kbd>NumLock</kbd> is unlocked and
        the keyboard actually has a numeric keypad, Firefox always returns
        <code>DOM_KEY_LOCATION_NUMPAD</code> too. On the other hand, if the
        keyboard doesn\[aq]t have a keypad, such as on a notebook computer, some
        keys become Numpad only when NumLock is locked. When such keys fires
        key events, the location attribute value depends on the key. That
        is, it must not be <code>DOM_KEY_LOCATION_NUMPAD</code>.
