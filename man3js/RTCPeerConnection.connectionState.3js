.SH NAME
RTCPeerConnection.connectionState \- RTCPeerConnection: connectionState
property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The read\-only \f[B]\f[CB]connectionState\f[B]\f[R] property of the
\f[CR]RTCPeerConnection\f[R] interface indicates the current state of
the peer connection by returning one of the following string values:
\f[CR]new\f[R], \f[CR]connecting\f[R], \f[CR]connected\f[R],
\f[CR]disconnected\f[R], \f[CR]failed\f[R], or \f[CR]closed\f[R].
.PP
This state essentially represents the aggregate state of all ICE
transports (which are of type \f[CR]RTCIceTransport\f[R] or
\f[CR]RTCDtlsTransport\f[R]) being used by the connection.
.PP
When this property\[cq]s value changes, a
\f[CR]connectionstatechange\f[R] event is sent to the
\f[CR]RTCPeerConnection\f[R] instance.
.SH VALUE
A string representing the current state of the connection.
This can take on of the following values:
.TP
\f[B]new\f[R]
At least one of the connection\[cq]s ICE transports
(\f[CR]RTCIceTransport\f[R] or \f[CR]RTCDtlsTransport\f[R] objects) is
in the \f[CR]new\f[R] state, and none of them are in one of the
following states: \f[CR]connecting\f[R], \f[CR]checking\f[R],
\f[CR]failed\f[R], \f[CR]disconnected\f[R], or all of the
connection\[cq]s transports are in the \f[CR]closed\f[R] state.
.TP
\f[B]connecting\f[R]
One or more of the ICE transports are currently in the process of
establishing a connection; that is, their \f[CR]iceConnectionState\f[R]
is either \f[CR]checking\f[R] or \f[CR]connected\f[R], and no transports
are in the \f[CR]failed\f[R] state.
.TP
\f[B]connected\f[R]
Every ICE transport used by the connection is either in use (state
\f[CR]connected\f[R] or \f[CR]completed\f[R]) or is closed (state
\f[CR]closed\f[R]); in addition, at least one transport is either
\f[CR]connected\f[R] or \f[CR]completed\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]disconnected\f[R]
At least one of the ICE transports for the connection is in the
\f[CR]disconnected\f[R] state and none of the other transports are in
the states: \f[CR]failed\f[R], \f[CR]connecting\f[R], or
\f[CR]checking\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]failed\f[R]
One or more of the ICE transports on the connection is in the
\f[CR]failed\f[R] state.
.TP
\f[B]closed\f[R]
The \f[CR]RTCPeerConnection\f[R] is closed.
