RTCOutboundRtpStreamStats: retransmittedBytesSent property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]retransmittedBytesSent\f[B]\f[R] property of the
\f[CR]RTCOutboundRtpStreamStats\f[R] dictionary represents the total
number of payload bytes retransmitted for the source associated with
this stream.
.PP
RTX (Retransmission) is one of several mechanisms that WebRTC uses for
retransmitting lost payload bytes, and broadly refers to support for the
special packets defined in RFC 4588.
RTX has to be negotiated between the sender and receiver during initial
handshake.
If RTX has not been negotiated the retransmitted bytes will be sent over
the same SSRC; otherwise the bytes are sent on a separate SSRC but are
still accounted for in this property.
.PP
The retransmitted bytes sent are included in the count reported by
\f[CR]bytesSent\f[R].
.SH VALUE
A positive integer indicating the number of retransmitted payload bytes
for the source.
