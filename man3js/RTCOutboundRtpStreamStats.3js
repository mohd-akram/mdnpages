.SH NAME
RTCOutboundRtpStreamStats \- RTCOutboundRtpStreamStats
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]RTCOutboundRtpStreamStats\f[B]\f[R] dictionary of the
WebRTC API is used to report metrics and statistics related to an
outbound RTP stream being sent by an \f[CR]RTCRtpSender\f[R].
.PP
The statistics can be obtained by iterating the
\f[CR]RTCStatsReport\f[R] returned by
\f[CR]RTCPeerConnection.getStats()\f[R] or
\f[CR]RTCRtpSender.getStats()\f[R] until you find a report with the
\f[CR]type\f[R] of \f[CR]outbound\-rtp\f[R].

A boolean that indicates whether this RTP stream is configured to be
sent, or is disabled.

An integer indicating the height of the last encoded frame, in pixels.
\f[I]Undefined for audio streams.\f[R]
.TP

A number that represents the encoded frames sent in the last second.
\f[I]Undefined for audio streams.\f[R]
.TP
\f[B]framesSent\f[R]
A positive integer that represents the total number of encoded frames
sent on this RTP stream.
\f[I]Undefined for audio streams.\f[R]
.TP
\f[B]headerBytesSent\f[R]

padding bytes sent for this SSRC.
.TP
\f[B]keyFramesEncoded\f[R] \f[I](experimental)\f[R]
A positive integer that represents the total number of key frames
successfully encoded in this RTP media stream.
\f[I]Undefined for audio streams.\f[R]
.TP
\f[B]mediaSourceId\f[R]
A string that represents the id of the stats object of the track
currently attached to the sender of this stream.
.TP
\f[B]mid\f[R]
A string that uniquely identifies the pairing of source and destination
of the transceiver\(cqs stream.
This is the value of the corresponding \f[CR]RTCRtpTransceiver.mid\f[R]
unless that is null, in which case the statistic property is not
present.
.TP
\f[B]nackCount\f[R]
An integer value indicating the total number of Negative ACKnowledgement
(NACK) packets this \f[CR]RTCRtpSender\f[R] has received from the remote
\f[CR]RTCRtpReceiver\f[R].
This locally\-computed value provides an indication of the error
resiliency of the connection.
.TP
\f[B]qpSum\f[R]
A 64\-bit value containing the sum of the QP values for every frame
encoded by this \f[CR]RTCRtpSender\f[R].
This locally\-computed value provides an indication of how heavily
compressed the data is.
\f[I]Undefined for audio streams.\f[R]
.TP
\f[B]qualityLimitationDurations\f[R] \f[I](experimental)\f[R]
A map of the reasons that a media stream\(cqs resolution or framerate
has been reduced, and the time that the quality was reduced for each
reason.
\f[I]Undefined for audio streams.\f[R]
.TP
\f[B]qualityLimitationReason\f[R] \f[I](experimental)\f[R]
A string indicating the reason why the stream is being quality\-limited.
One of: \f[CR]none\f[R], \f[CR]cpu\f[R], \f[CR]bandwidth\f[R], or
\f[CR]other\f[R].
\f[I]Undefined for audio streams.\f[R]
.TP
\f[B]remoteId\f[R]
A string which identifies the \f[CR]RTCRemoteInboundRtpStreamStats\f[R]
object that provides statistics for the remote peer for this same SSRC.
This ID is stable across multiple calls to \f[CR]getStats()\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]retransmittedBytesSent\f[R]
A positive integer that represents the total number of payload bytes
retransmitted for the source associated with this stream.
.TP
\f[B]retransmittedPacketsSent\f[R]
A positive integer that represents the total number of packets
retransmitted for the source associated with this stream.
.TP
\f[B]rid\f[R]
A string that indicates the RTP stream ID for a corresponding video
stream.
.TP
\f[B]scalabilityMode\f[R] \f[I](experimental)\f[R]
A string that represents the scalability mode for the RTP stream, if one
has been configured.
.TP
\f[B]targetBitrate\f[R]
A number that represents the bit rate that the
\f[CR]RTCRtpSender\f[R]\(cqs codec is currently attempting to achieve
for the stream.
.TP
\f[B]totalEncodeTime\f[R]
A number that represents the total number of seconds that have been
spent encoding the frames encoded for this stream
\f[CR]RTCRtpSender\f[R].
\f[I]Undefined for audio streams.\f[R]
.TP
\f[B]totalEncodedBytesTarget\f[R] \f[I](experimental)\f[R]
A cumulative sum of the \f[I]target\f[R] frame sizes for all of the
frames encoded so far.
This will likely differ from the total of the \f[I]actual\f[R] frame
sizes.
\f[I]Undefined for audio streams.\f[R]
.TP
\f[B]totalPacketSendDelay\f[R]
A number that represents the total time in seconds that packets have
spent buffered locally before being transmitted.
.SS Sent RTP stream statistics
.TP
\f[B]bytesSent\f[R] \f[I](optional)\f[R]
A positive integer indicating the total number of bytes sent for this
SSRC, including retransmissions.
.TP
\f[B]packetsSent\f[R] \f[I](optional)\f[R]

produce the \f[CR]RTCCodecStats\f[R] object associated with this RTP
stream.
.TP
\f[B]kind\f[R]
A string indicating whether the \f[CR]MediaStreamTrack\f[R] associated
with the stream is an audio or a video track.
.TP

stream.
.TP
\f[B]transportId\f[R] \f[I](optional)\f[R]
A string that uniquely identifies the object which was inspected to
produce the \f[CR]RTCTransportStats\f[R] object associated with this RTP
stream.
.SS Common instance properties
The following properties are common to all WebRTC statistics objects.
.TP
\f[B]id\f[R]
A string that uniquely identifies the object that is being monitored to
produce this set of statistics.
.TP
