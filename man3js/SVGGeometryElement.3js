.SH NAME
SVGGeometryElement \- SVGGeometryElement
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[CR]SVGGeometryElement\f[R] interface represents SVG elements
whose rendering is defined by geometry with an equivalent path, and
which can be filled and stroked.
This includes paths and the basic shapes.
.SH INSTANCE PROPERTIES
\f[I]This interface also inherits properties from its parent,
\f[CI]SVGGraphicsElement\f[I].\f[R]
.TP
\f[B]SVGGeometryElement.pathLength\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
This property reflects the \f[CR]pathLength\f[R] attribute.
.SH INSTANCE METHODS
\f[I]This interface also inherits methods from its parent,
\f[CI]SVGGraphicsElement\f[I].\f[R]
.TP
\f[B]SVGGeometryElement.isPointInFill()\f[R]
Determines whether a given point is within the fill shape of an element.
Normal hit testing rules apply; the value of the
\f[CR]pointer\-events\f[R] property on the element determines whether a
point is considered to be within the fill.
.TP
\f[B]SVGGeometryElement.isPointInStroke()\f[R]
Determines whether a given point is within the stroke shape of an
element.
Normal hit testing rules apply; the value of the
\f[CR]pointer\-events\f[R] property on the element determines whether a
point is considered to be within the stroke.
.TP
\f[B]SVGGeometryElement.getTotalLength()\f[R]
Returns the user agent\[cq]s computed value for the total length of the
path in user units.
.TP
\f[B]SVGGeometryElement.getPointAtLength()\f[R]
Returns the point at a given distance along the path.
