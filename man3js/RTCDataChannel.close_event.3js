.SH NAME
RTCDataChannel.close_event \- RTCDataChannel: close event
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]close\f[B]\f[R] event is sent to the \f[CR]onclose\f[R]
event handler on an \f[CR]RTCDataChannel\f[R] instance when the data
transport for the data channel has closed.
Before any further data can be transferred using
\f[CR]RTCDataChannel\f[R], a new `RTCDataChannel' instance must be
created.
.PP
This event is not cancelable and does not bubble.
.SH SYNTAX
Use the event name in methods like \f[CR]addEventListener()\f[R], or set
an event handler property.
.IP
.EX
addEventListener(\(dqclose\(dq, (event) => { })

onclose = (event) => { }
.EE
.SH EVENT TYPE
A generic \f[CR]Event\f[R].
.SH EXAMPLES
This example sets up a handler for the \f[CR]close\f[R] event for the
\f[CR]RTCDataChannel\f[R] named \f[CR]dc\f[R]; its responsibility in
this example is to update user interface elements to reflect that there
is no longer an ongoing call, and to allow a new call to be started.
.IP
.EX
dc.addEventListener(
  \(dqclose\(dq,
  (ev) \f[B]=>\f[R] {
    messageInputBox.disabled = \f[B]true\f[R];
    sendButton.disabled = \f[B]true\f[R];
    connectButton.disabled = \f[B]false\f[R];
    disconnectButton.disabled = \f[B]true\f[R];
  },
  \f[B]false\f[R],
);
.EE
.PP
All this code does in response to receiving the \f[CR]close\f[R] event
is to disable an input box and its \(lqSend\(rq button, and to enable
the button used to start a call (while disabling the one that ends a
call).
.PP
You can also use the \f[CR]onclose\f[R] event handler property to set a
handler for \f[CR]close\f[R] events:
.IP
.EX
dc.onclose = (ev) \f[B]=>\f[R] {
  messageInputBox.disabled = \f[B]true\f[R];
  sendButton.disabled = \f[B]true\f[R];
  connectButton.disabled = \f[B]false\f[R];
  disconnectButton.disabled = \f[B]true\f[R];
};
