HTMLSourceElement \- HTMLSourceElement
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]HTMLSourceElement\f[B]\f[R] interface provides special
properties (beyond the regular \f[CR]HTMLElement\f[R] object interface
it also has available to it by inheritance) for manipulating
\f[CR]<source>\f[R] elements.
.SH INSTANCE PROPERTIES
\f[I]Inherits properties from its parent, \f[CI]HTMLElement\f[I].\f[R]
.TP
\f[B]HTMLSourceElement.height\f[R]
A number that reflects the \f[CR]height\f[R] HTML attribute, indicating
the height of the image resource in CSS pixels.
The property has a meaning only if the parent of the current
\f[CR]<source>\f[R] element is a \f[CR]<picture>\f[R] element.
.TP
\f[B]HTMLSourceElement.media\f[R]
A string reflecting the \f[CR]media\f[R] HTML attribute, containing the
intended type of the media resource.
.TP
\f[B]HTMLSourceElement.sizes\f[R]
A string representing image sizes between breakpoints
.TP
\f[B]HTMLSourceElement.src\f[R]
A string reflecting the \f[CR]src\f[R] HTML attribute, containing the
URL for the media resource.
The \f[CR]HTMLSourceElement.src\f[R] property has a meaning only when
the associated \f[CR]<source>\f[R] element is nested in a media element
that is a \f[CR]<video>\f[R] or an \f[CR]<audio>\f[R] element.
It has no meaning and is ignored when it is nested in a
\f[CR]<picture>\f[R] element.

\f[B]Note:\f[R] If the \f[CR]src\f[R] property is updated (along with
any siblings), the parent \f[CR]HTMLMediaElement\f[R]\[cq]s
\f[CR]load\f[R] method should be called when done, since
\f[CR]<source>\f[R] elements are not re\-scanned automatically.

(\f[CR]\[aq],\[aq], U+002C COMMA\f[R]).
A candidate image is a URL followed by a \f[CR]\[aq]w\[aq]\f[R] with the
width of the images, or an \f[CR]\[aq]x\[aq]\f[R] followed by the pixel
density.
