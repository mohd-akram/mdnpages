.SH NAME
AudioTrackList \- AudioTrackList
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]AudioTrackList\f[B]\f[R] interface is used to represent a
list of the audio tracks contained within a given HTML media element,
with each track represented by a separate \f[CR]AudioTrack\f[R] object
in the list.
.PP
Retrieve an instance of this object with
\f[CR]HTMLMediaElement.audioTracks\f[R].
The individual tracks can be accessed using array syntax.
.SH INSTANCE PROPERTIES
\f[I]This interface also inherits properties from its parent interface,
\f[CI]EventTarget\f[I].\f[R]
.TP
\f[B]length\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
The number of tracks in the list.
.SH INSTANCE METHODS
\f[I]This interface also inherits methods from its parent interface,
\f[CI]EventTarget\f[I].\f[R]
.TP
\f[B]getTrackById()\f[R]
Returns the \f[CR]AudioTrack\f[R] found within the
\f[CR]AudioTrackList\f[R] whose \f[CR]id\f[R] matches the specified
string.
If no match is found, \f[CR]null\f[R] is returned.
.SH EVENTS
.TP
\f[B]addtrack\f[R]
Fired when a new audio track has been added to the media element.
.TP
\f[B]change\f[R]
Fired when a track has been enabled or disabled.
.TP
\f[B]removetrack\f[R]
Fired when a new audio track has been removed from the media element.
.SH USAGE NOTES
In addition to being able to obtain direct access to the audio tracks
present on a media element, \f[CR]AudioTrackList\f[R] lets you set event
handlers on the \f[CR]addtrack\f[R] and \f[CR]removetrack\f[R] events,
so that you can detect when tracks are added to or removed from the
media element\[cq]s stream.
See the \f[CR]addtrack\f[R] and \f[CR]removetrack\f[R] events for
details and examples.
.SH EXAMPLES
.SS Getting a media element\[cq]s audio track list
To get a media element\[cq]s \f[CR]AudioTrackList\f[R], use its
\f[CR]audioTracks\f[R] property.
.IP
.EX
\f[B]const\f[R] audioTracks = document.querySelector(\[dq]video\[dq]).audioTracks;
.EE
.SS Monitoring track count changes
In this example, we have an app that displays information about the
number of channels available.
To keep it up to date, handlers for the \f[CR]addtrack\f[R] and
\f[CR]removetrack\f[R] events are set up.
.IP
.EX
audioTracks.onaddtrack = updateTrackCount;
audioTracks.onremovetrack = updateTrackCount;

\f[B]function\f[R] updateTrackCount(event) {
  trackCount = audioTracks.length;
  drawTrackCountIndicator(trackCount);
}
.EE
