.SH NAME
HTMLImageElement.fetchPriority \- HTMLImageElement: fetchPriority
property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]fetchPriority\f[B]\f[R] property of the
\f[CR]HTMLImageElement\f[R] interface represents a hint to the browser
indicating how it should prioritize fetching a particular image relative
to other images.
It reflects the \f[CR]fetchpriority\f[R] attribute of the corresponding
\f[CR]<img>\f[R] element.
.PP
The property allows a developer to signal that fetching a particular
image early in the loading process has more or less impact on user
experience than a browser can reasonably infer when assigning an
internal priority.
This in turn allows the browser to increase or decrease the priority,
and potentially load the image earlier or later than it would otherwise.
The property should be used sparingly, as excessive or incorrect
prioritization can degrade performance.
.PP
The fetch priority can be used to complement preloading, allowing a
developer to boost the priority ahead of less\-impactful resources that
have a higher default priority.
For example, if a developer knows that a particular image significantly
contributes to the website\(cqs Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) they
could add \f[CR]<link rel=\(dqpreload\(dq>\f[R] for the image and then
further boost the priority using the \f[CR]fetchpriority\f[R] property.
.PP
Note that both the internal priority of any fetch operation, and the
impact of \f[CR]fetchPriority\f[R] on the priority, are entirely browser
dependent.
.SH VALUE
A string representing the priority hint.
Possible values are:
.TP
\f[B]high\f[R]
Fetch the image at a high priority relative to other images with the
same internal prioritization.
.TP
\f[B]low\f[R]
Fetch the image at a low priority relative to other images with the same
internal prioritization.
.TP
\f[B]auto\f[R]
Don\(cqt set a user preference for the fetch priority.
This is the default.
It is used if no value is set or if an invalid value is set.
