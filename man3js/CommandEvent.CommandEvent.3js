\f[CR]input\f[R].

An \f[CR]HTMLButtonElement\f[R] representing the button that was

While manually instantiating a \f[CR]CommandEvent\f[R] it is possible to
use any string value, but it is recommended to use one of the built\-in
names or prefix with two dashes (\f[CR]\-\-\f[R]) to ensure forward
compatibility.
