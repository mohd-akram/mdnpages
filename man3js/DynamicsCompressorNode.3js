.SH NAME
DynamicsCompressorNode \- DynamicsCompressorNode
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[CR]DynamicsCompressorNode\f[R] interface provides a compression
effect, which lowers the volume of the loudest parts of the signal in
order to help prevent clipping and distortion that can occur when
multiple sounds are played and multiplexed together at once.
This is often used in musical production and game audio.
\f[CR]DynamicsCompressorNode\f[R] is an \f[CR]AudioNode\f[R] that has
exactly one input and one output.

.SH CONSTRUCTOR
.TP
\f[B]DynamicsCompressorNode()\f[R]
Creates a new instance of an \f[CR]DynamicsCompressorNode\f[R] object.
.SH INSTANCE PROPERTIES
\f[I]Inherits properties from its parent, \f[CI]AudioNode\f[I]\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]DynamicsCompressorNode.threshold\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
A k\-rate \f[CR]AudioParam\f[R] representing the decibel value above
which the compression will start taking effect.
.TP
\f[B]DynamicsCompressorNode.knee\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
A k\-rate \f[CR]AudioParam\f[R] containing a decibel value representing
the range above the threshold where the curve smoothly transitions to
the compressed portion.
.TP
\f[B]DynamicsCompressorNode.ratio\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
A k\-rate \f[CR]AudioParam\f[R] representing the amount of change, in
dB, needed in the input for a 1 dB change in the output.
.TP
\f[B]DynamicsCompressorNode.reduction\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
A \f[CR]float\f[R] representing the amount of gain reduction currently
applied by the compressor to the signal.
.TP
\f[B]DynamicsCompressorNode.attack\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
A k\-rate \f[CR]AudioParam\f[R] representing the amount of time, in
seconds, required to reduce the gain by 10 dB.
.TP
\f[B]DynamicsCompressorNode.release\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
A k\-rate \f[CR]AudioParam\f[R] representing the amount of time, in
seconds, required to increase the gain by 10 dB.
.SH INSTANCE METHODS
\f[I]No specific methods; inherits methods from its parent,
\f[CI]AudioNode\f[I]\f[R].
.SH EXAMPLE
