.SH NAME
RTCPeerConnectionIceErrorEvent.address \-
RTCPeerConnectionIceErrorEvent: address property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[CR]RTCPeerConnectionIceErrorEvent\f[R] property
\f[B]\f[CB]address\f[B]\f[R] is a string which indicates the local IP
address being used to communicate with the STUN or TURN server during
negotiations.
The error which occurred involved this address.
.SH VALUE
A string which specifies the local IP address of the network connection
to the ICE server with which negotiations were occurring when the error
occurred.
This address identifies the network interface on the local device which
is being used to attempt to establish the connection to the remote peer.
.PP
This can be useful on multi\-homed systems\[em]devices with more than
one network connection\[em]to determine which network interface is being
used.
For example, on a mobile phone, there are typically at least two network
interfaces available: the cellular connection and a Wi\-Fi connection.
.PP
If the local IP address isn\[cq]t exposed as part of a local candidate,
the value of \f[CR]address\f[R] is \f[CR]null\f[R].
.SH EXAMPLES
This example creates a handler for \f[CR]icecandidateerror\f[R] events
which creates human\-readable messages describing the local network
interface for the connection as well as the ICE server that was being
used to try to open the connection, then calls a function to display
those as well as the event\[cq]s \f[CR]errorText\f[R] property\[cq]s
contents.

.EX
pc.addEventListener(\[dq]icecandidateerror\[dq], (event) \f[B]=>\f[R] {
  \f[B]let\f[R] networkInfo = \[ga][Local interface: ${event.address}:${event.port}\[ga];
  \f[B]let\f[R] iceServerInfo = \[ga][ICE server: ${event.url}\[ga];

  showMessage(errorText, iceServerInfo, networkInfo);
});
