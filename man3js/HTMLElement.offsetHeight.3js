.SH NAME
HTMLElement.offsetHeight \- HTMLElement: offsetHeight property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]offsetHeight\f[B]\f[R] read\-only property of the
\f[CR]HTMLElement\f[R] interface returns the height of an element,
including vertical padding and borders, as an integer.
.PP
Typically, \f[CR]offsetHeight\f[R] is a measurement in pixels of the
element\(cqs CSS height, including any borders, padding, and horizontal
scrollbars (if rendered).
It does not include the height of pseudo\-elements such as
\f[CR]::before\f[R] or \f[CR]::after\f[R].
For the document body object, the measurement includes total linear
content height instead of the element\(cqs CSS height.
Floated elements extending below other linear content are ignored.
.PP
If the element is hidden (for example, by setting
\f[CR]style.display\f[R] on the element or one of its ancestors to
\f[CR]\(dqnone\(dq\f[R]), then \f[CR]0\f[R] is returned.
.SH VALUE
An integer.
.SH EXAMPLES
[IMAGE: An example element with large padding, border and margin.
\f[CR]offsetHeight\f[R] is the layout height of the element including
its padding and border, and excluding its margin.]
An example element with large padding, border and margin.
\f[CR]offsetHeight\f[R] is the layout height of the element including
its padding and border, and excluding its margin.
.PP
The example image above shows a scrollbar and an \f[CR]offsetHeight\f[R]
which fits on the window.
However, non\-scrollable elements may have large \f[CR]offsetHeight\f[R]
values, much larger than the visible content.
These elements are typically contained within scrollable elements;
consequently, these non\-scrollable elements may be completely or partly
invisible, depending on the \f[CR]scrollTop\f[R] setting of the
scrollable container.
