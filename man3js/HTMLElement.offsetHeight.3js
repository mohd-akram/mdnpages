.SH NAME
HTMLElement.offsetHeight \- HTMLElement: offsetHeight property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]HTMLElement.offsetHeight\f[B]\f[R] read\-only property
returns the height of an element, including vertical padding and
borders, as an integer.
.PP
Typically, \f[CR]offsetHeight\f[R] is a measurement in pixels of the
element\[cq]s CSS height, including any borders, padding, and horizontal
scrollbars (if rendered).
It does not include the height of pseudo\-elements such as
\f[CR]::before\f[R] or \f[CR]::after\f[R].
For the document body object, the measurement includes total linear
content height instead of the element\[cq]s CSS height.
Floated elements extending below other linear content are ignored.
.PP
If the element is hidden (for example, by setting
\f[CR]style.display\f[R] on the element or one of its ancestors to
\f[CR]\[dq]none\[dq]\f[R]), then \f[CR]0\f[R] is returned.
.RS
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R] This property will round the value to an integer.
If you need a fractional value, use
\f[CR]element.getBoundingClientRect()\f[R].
.RE
.SH VALUE
A number.
.SH EXAMPLES
[IMAGE: An example element with large padding, border and margin.
\f[CR]offsetHeight\f[R] is the layout height of the element including
its padding and border, and excluding its margin.]
An example element with large padding, border and margin.
\f[CR]offsetHeight\f[R] is the layout height of the element including
its padding and border, and excluding its margin.
.PP
The example image above shows a scrollbar and an \f[CR]offsetHeight\f[R]
which fits on the window.
However, non\-scrollable elements may have large \f[CR]offsetHeight\f[R]
values, much larger than the visible content.
These elements are typically contained within scrollable elements;
consequently, these non\-scrollable elements may be completely or partly
invisible, depending on the \f[CR]scrollTop\f[R] setting of the
scrollable container.
