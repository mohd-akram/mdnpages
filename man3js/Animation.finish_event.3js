.SH NAME
Animation.finish_event \- Animation: finish event
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]finish\f[B]\f[R] event of the \f[CR]Animation\f[R]
interface is fired when the animation finishes playing, either when the
animation completes naturally, or when the \f[CR]Animation.finish()\f[R]
method is called to immediately cause the animation to finish up.
.RS
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R] The \f[CR]\(dqpaused\(dq\f[R] play state supersedes the
\f[CR]\(dqfinished\(dq\f[R] play state; if the animation is both paused
and finished, the \f[CR]\(dqpaused\(dq\f[R] state is the one that will
be reported.
You can force the animation into the \f[CR]\(dqfinished\(dq\f[R] state
by setting its \f[CR]startTime\f[R] to
\f[CR]document.timeline.currentTime \- (Animation.currentTime * Animation.playbackRate)\f[R].
.RE
.SH SYNTAX
Use the event name in methods like \f[CR]addEventListener()\f[R], or set
an event handler property.

\&.
Here is one instance where we add pointer events back to an element
after its opacity animation has faded it in:
.IP
.EX
\f[I]// Add an animation to the game\(aqs ending credits\f[R]
\f[B]const\f[R] endingUI = document.getElementById(\(dqending\-ui\(dq);
\f[B]const\f[R] bringUI = endingUI.animate(keysFade, timingFade);

\f[I]// Pause said animation\(aqs credits\f[R]
bringUI.pause();

\f[I]// This function removes pointer events on the credits.\f[R]
hide(endingUI);

\f[I]// When the credits are later faded in,\f[R]
\f[I]// we re\-add the pointer events when they\(aqre done\f[R]
bringUI.onfinish = (event) \f[B]=>\f[R] {
  endingUI.style.pointerEvents = \(dqauto\(dq;
};
