.SH NAME
Element.securitypolicyviolation_event \- Element:
securitypolicyviolation event
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]securitypolicyviolation\f[B]\f[R] event is fired when a
Content Security Policy is violated.
.PP
The event is fired on the element that violates the policy and bubbles.
It is normally handled by an event handler on the \f[CR]Window\f[R] or
\f[CR]Document\f[R] object.
.PP
The handler can be assigned using the
\f[CR]onsecuritypolicyviolation\f[R] property or using
\f[CR]EventTarget.addEventListener()\f[R].
.RS
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R] You must add the handler for this event to a top level
object (i.e.\ \f[CR]Window\f[R] or \f[CR]Document\f[R]).
While the property exists in HTML elements, you can\[cq]t assign a
handler to the property until the elements have been loaded, by which
time this event will already have fired.
.RE
.SH SYNTAX
Use the event name in methods like \f[CR]addEventListener()\f[R], or set
an event handler property.
.IP
.EX
addEventListener(\[dq]securitypolicyviolation\[dq], (event) => {});

onsecuritypolicyviolation = (event) => {};
.EE
.SH EVENT TYPE
A \f[CR]SecurityPolicyViolationEvent\f[R].
Inherits from \f[CR]Event\f[R].
.SH EXAMPLES
The code below shows how you might add an event handler function using
the \f[CR]onsecuritypolicyviolation\f[R] global event handler property
or \f[CR]addEventListener()\f[R] on the top level \f[CR]Window\f[R] (you
could use exactly the same approach on \f[CR]Document\f[R]).
.IP
.EX
window.onsecuritypolicyviolation = (e) => {
  // Handle SecurityPolicyViolationEvent e here
};

window.addEventListener(\[dq]securitypolicyviolation\[dq], (e) => {
  // Handle SecurityPolicyViolationEvent e here
});
