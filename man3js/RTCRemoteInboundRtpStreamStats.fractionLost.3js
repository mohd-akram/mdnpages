.SH NAME
RTCRemoteInboundRtpStreamStats.fractionLost \-
RTCRemoteInboundRtpStreamStats: fractionLost property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]fractionLost\f[B]\f[R] property of the
\f[CR]RTCRemoteInboundRtpStreamStats\f[R] dictionary provides a value
that can be used to determine the fraction of packets lost for this
synchronization source (SSRC) in the last reporting interval.
.PP
To convert the value to a percentage, divide it by 256 and multiply by
100.
For example, a value of 20 indicates a 7.8% packet loss.
.PP
Note that the value may not be precisely accurate due to the way that it
is calculated, but it does provides a quick and convenient measure of
the link quality.
.SH VALUE
A number giving the fraction packet loss in the last reporting interval,
multiplied by 256.
The value is 0 if the calculated packet loss is negative.
.RS
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R] The value comes from the 8\-bit \f[CR]fraction lost\f[R]
field of the last Sender Report (SR) or Receiver Report (RR) RTCP
packet.
The algorithm for calculating the value is defined in \c
