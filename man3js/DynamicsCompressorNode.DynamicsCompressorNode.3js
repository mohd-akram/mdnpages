.SH NAME
DynamicsCompressorNode.DynamicsCompressorNode \- DynamicsCompressorNode:
DynamicsCompressorNode() constructor
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]DynamicsCompressorNode()\f[B]\f[R] constructor creates a
new \f[CR]DynamicsCompressorNode\f[R] object which provides a
compression effect, which lowers the volume of the loudest parts of the
signal, in order to help prevent clipping and distortion.
That can occur when multiple sounds are played and multiplexed together
at once.
