.SH NAME
Animation.currentTime \- Animation: currentTime property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]Animation.currentTime\f[B]\f[R] property of the Web
Animations API returns and sets the current time value of the animation
in milliseconds, whether running or paused.
.PP
If the animation lacks a \f[CR]timeline\f[R], is inactive, or hasn\[cq]t
been played yet, \f[CR]currentTime\f[R]\[cq]s return value is
\f[CR]null\f[R].
.SH VALUE
A number representing the current time in milliseconds, or
\f[CR]null\f[R] to deactivate the animation.
.SH EXAMPLES
In the \c
.UR https://codepen.io/rachelnabors/pen/PNYGZQ?editors=0010
Drink Me/Eat Me game
.UE \c
, Alice\[cq]s height is animated so it can go from small to large or
large to small.
At the start of the game, her height is set between the two extremes by
setting her animation\[cq]s \f[CR]currentTime\f[R] to half her
\f[CR]KeyframeEffect\f[R]\[cq]s duration:
.IP
.EX
aliceChange.currentTime = aliceChange.effect.timing.duration / 2;
.EE
.PP
A more generic means of seeking to the 50% mark of an animation would
be:
.IP
.EX
animation.currentTime =
  animation.effect.getComputedTiming().delay +
  animation.effect.getComputedTiming().activeDuration / 2;
.EE
.SH REDUCED TIME PRECISION
To offer protection against timing attacks and fingerprinting, the
precision of \f[CR]animation.currentTime\f[R] might get rounded
depending on browser settings.
In Firefox, the \f[CR]privacy.reduceTimerPrecision\f[R] preference is
enabled by default and defaults to 20 microseconds in Firefox 59; in 60
it will be 2 milliseconds.

\f[I]// reduced time precision (2ms) in Firefox 60\f[R]
animation.currentTime;
\f[I]// 23.404\f[R]

\f[I]// 51.7\f[R]
\f[I]// \&...\f[R]

.PP
In Firefox, you can also enabled
\f[CR]privacy.resistFingerprinting\f[R], the precision will be 100ms or
the value of
\f[CR]privacy.resistFingerprinting.reduceTimerPrecision.microseconds\f[R],
whichever is larger.
