.SH NAME
OffscreenCanvas.convertToBlob \- OffscreenCanvas: convertToBlob() method
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f[B]Note:\f[R] This feature is available in Web Workers.
.PP
The \f[B]\f[CB]OffscreenCanvas.convertToBlob()\f[B]\f[R] method creates
a \f[CR]Blob\f[R] object representing the image contained in the canvas.
.PP
The desired file format and image quality may be specified.
If the file format is not specified, or if the given format is not
supported, then the data will be exported as \f[CR]image/png\f[R].
Browsers are required to support \f[CR]image/png\f[R]; many will support
additional formats including \f[CR]image/jpeg\f[R] and
\f[CR]image/webp\f[R].
.PP
The created image will have a resolution of 96dpi for file formats that
support encoding resolution metadata.

.SS Parameters
.TP
\f[B]options\f[R] \f[I](optional)\f[R]
An object with the following properties:
.RS
.TP
\f[B]type\f[R]
A string indicating the image format.
The default type is \f[CR]image/png\f[R]; this image format will be also
used if the specified type is not supported.
.TP
\f[B]quality\f[R]
A \f[CR]Number\f[R] between \f[CR]0\f[R] and \f[CR]1\f[R] indicating the
image quality to be used when creating images using file formats that
support lossy compression (such as \f[CR]image/jpeg\f[R] or
\f[CR]image/webp\f[R]).
A user agent will use its default quality value if this option is not
specified, or if the number is outside the allowed range.
.RE
.SS Return value
A \f[CR]Promise\f[R] returning a \f[CR]Blob\f[R] object representing the
image contained in the canvas.
.SS Exceptions
The promise may be rejected with the following exceptions:
.TP
\f[B]InvalidStateError\f[R] \f[B]DOMException\f[R]
The \f[CR]OffscreenCanvas\f[R] is not detached; in other words it still
associated with the DOM and not the current worker.
.TP
\f[B]SecurityError\f[R] \f[B]DOMException\f[R]
The canvas context mode is 2d and the bitmap is not origin\-clean; at
least some of its contents have or may have been loaded from a site
other than the one from which the document itself was loaded.
.TP
\f[B]IndexSizeError\f[R] \f[B]DOMException\f[R]
The canvas bitmap has no pixels (either the horizontal or vertical
dimension is zero).
.TP
\f[B]EncodingError\f[R] \f[B]DOMException\f[R]
The blob could not be created due to an encoding error.
.SH EXAMPLES
.IP
.EX
\f[B]const\f[R] offscreen = \f[B]new\f[R] OffscreenCanvas(256, 256);
\f[B]const\f[R] gl = offscreen.getContext(\[dq]webgl\[dq]);

\f[I]// Perform some drawing using the gl context\f[R]

offscreen.convertToBlob().then((blob) \f[B]=>\f[R] console.log(blob));
\f[I]// Blob { size: 334, type: \[dq]image/png\[dq] }\f[R]
