.SH NAME
PannerNode \- PannerNode
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[CR]PannerNode\f[R] interface defines an audio\-processing object
that represents the location, direction, and behavior of an audio source
signal in a simulated physical space.
This \f[CR]AudioNode\f[R] uses right\-hand Cartesian coordinates to
describe the source\[cq]s \f[I]position\f[R] as a vector and its
\f[I]orientation\f[R] as a 3D directional cone.
.PP
A \f[CR]PannerNode\f[R] always has exactly one input and one output: the
input can be \f[I]mono\f[R] or \f[I]stereo\f[R] but the output is always
\f[I]stereo\f[R] (2 channels); you can\[cq]t have panning effects
without at least two audio channels!

.SH CONSTRUCTOR
.TP
\f[B]PannerNode()\f[R]
Creates a new \f[CR]PannerNode\f[R] object instance.
.SH INSTANCE PROPERTIES
\f[I]Inherits properties from its parent, \f[CI]AudioNode\f[I]\f[R].
.RS
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R] The orientation and position value are set and retrieved
using different syntaxes, since they\[cq]re stored as
\f[CR]AudioParam\f[R] values.
Retrieval is done by accessing, for example,
\f[CR]PannerNode.positionX\f[R].
While setting the same property is done with
\f[CR]PannerNode.positionX.value\f[R].
This is why these values are not marked read only, which is how they
appear in the WebIDL.
.RE
.TP
\f[B]PannerNode.coneInnerAngle\f[R]
A double value describing the angle, in degrees, of a cone inside of
which there will be no volume reduction.
.TP
\f[B]PannerNode.coneOuterAngle\f[R]
A double value describing the angle, in degrees, of a cone outside of
which the volume will be reduced by a constant value, defined by the
\f[CR]coneOuterGain\f[R] property.
.TP
\f[B]PannerNode.coneOuterGain\f[R]
A double value describing the amount of volume reduction outside the
cone defined by the \f[CR]coneOuterAngle\f[R] attribute.
Its default value is \f[CR]0\f[R], meaning that no sound can be heard.
.TP
\f[B]PannerNode.distanceModel\f[R]
An enumerated value determining which algorithm to use to reduce the
volume of the audio source as it moves away from the listener.
Possible values are \f[CR]\[dq]linear\[dq]\f[R],
\f[CR]\[dq]inverse\[dq]\f[R] and \f[CR]\[dq]exponential\[dq]\f[R].
The default value is \f[CR]\[dq]inverse\[dq]\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]PannerNode.maxDistance\f[R]
A double value representing the maximum distance between the audio
source and the listener, after which the volume is not reduced any
further.
.TP
\f[B]PannerNode.orientationX\f[R]
Represents the horizontal position of the audio source\[cq]s vector in a
right\-hand Cartesian coordinate system.
While this \f[CR]AudioParam\f[R] cannot be directly changed, its value
can be altered using its \f[CR]value\f[R] property.
The default is value is 1.
.TP
\f[B]PannerNode.orientationY\f[R]
Represents the vertical position of the audio source\[cq]s vector in a
right\-hand Cartesian coordinate system.
The default is 0.
While this \f[CR]AudioParam\f[R] cannot be directly changed, its value
can be altered using its \f[CR]value\f[R] property.
The default is value is 0.
.TP
\f[B]PannerNode.orientationZ\f[R]
Represents the longitudinal (back and forth) position of the audio
source\[cq]s vector in a right\-hand Cartesian coordinate system.
The default is 0.
While this \f[CR]AudioParam\f[R] cannot be directly changed, its value
can be altered using its \f[CR]value\f[R] property.
The default is value is 0.
.TP
\f[B]PannerNode.panningModel\f[R]
An enumerated value determining which spatialization algorithm to use to
position the audio in 3D space.
.TP
\f[B]PannerNode.positionX\f[R]
Represents the horizontal position of the audio in a right\-hand
Cartesian coordinate system.
The default is 0.
While this \f[CR]AudioParam\f[R] cannot be directly changed, its value
can be altered using its \f[CR]value\f[R] property.
The default is value is 0.
.TP
\f[B]PannerNode.positionY\f[R]
Represents the vertical position of the audio in a right\-hand Cartesian
coordinate system.
The default is 0.
While this \f[CR]AudioParam\f[R] cannot be directly changed, its value
can be altered using its \f[CR]value\f[R] property.
The default is value is 0.
.TP
\f[B]PannerNode.positionZ\f[R]
Represents the longitudinal (back and forth) position of the audio in a
right\-hand Cartesian coordinate system.
The default is 0.
While this \f[CR]AudioParam\f[R] cannot be directly changed, its value
can be altered using its \f[CR]value\f[R] property.
The default is value is 0.
.TP
\f[B]PannerNode.refDistance\f[R]
A double value representing the reference distance for reducing volume
as the audio source moves further from the listener.
For distances greater than this the volume will be reduced based on
\f[CR]rolloffFactor\f[R] and \f[CR]distanceModel\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]PannerNode.rolloffFactor\f[R]
A double value describing how quickly the volume is reduced as the
source moves away from the listener.
This value is used by all distance models.
.SH INSTANCE METHODS
\f[I]Inherits methods from its parent, \f[CI]AudioNode\f[I]\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]PannerNode.setPosition()\f[R] \f[I](deprecated)\f[R]
Defines the position of the audio source relative to the listener
(represented by an \f[CR]AudioListener\f[R] object stored in the
\f[CR]BaseAudioContext.listener\f[R] attribute.)
.TP
\f[B]PannerNode.setOrientation()\f[R] \f[I](deprecated)\f[R]
Defines the direction the audio source is playing in.
