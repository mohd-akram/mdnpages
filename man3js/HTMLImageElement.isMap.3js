.SH NAME
HTMLImageElement.isMap \- HTMLImageElement: isMap property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[CR]HTMLImageElement\f[R] property \f[B]\f[CB]isMap\f[B]\f[R] is a
Boolean value which indicates that the image is to be used by a
server\-side image map.
This may only be used on images located within an \f[CR]<a>\f[R]
element.

\f[B]Note:\f[R] For accessibility reasons, you should generally avoid
using server\-side image maps, as they require the use of a mouse.
Use a client\-side image map instead.
.RE
.SH VALUE
A Boolean value which is \f[CR]true\f[R] if the image is being used for
a server\-side image map; otherwise, the value is \f[CR]false\f[R].
.SH USAGE NOTES
When an image marked as being part of a server\-side image map is
clicked, the browser constructs the string \[lq]?x,y\[rq], where x and y
indicate the coordinates at which the mouse was clicked as offsets from
the top\-left corner of the image, specified in CSS pixels.
.PP
The browser then fetches that URL from the server and displays or
downloads it depending on the value of the \f[CR]download\f[R]
attribute.
.PP
Unlike server\-side image maps, client\-side image maps don\[cq]t cause
the \f[CR]<img>\f[R] element to adopt interactive content mode.
