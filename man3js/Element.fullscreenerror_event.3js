.SH NAME
Element.fullscreenerror_event \- Element: fullscreenerror event
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[CR]fullscreenerror\f[R] event is fired when the browser cannot
switch to fullscreen mode.
.PP
As with the \f[CR]fullscreenchange\f[R] event, two
\f[CR]fullscreenerror\f[R] events are fired; the first is sent to the
\f[CR]Element\f[R] which failed to change modes, and the second is sent
to the \f[CR]Document\f[R] which owns that element.
.PP
For some reasons that switching into fullscreen mode might fail, see the
guide to the Fullscreen API.
.PP
This event is not cancelable.
.SH SYNTAX

an event handler property.
