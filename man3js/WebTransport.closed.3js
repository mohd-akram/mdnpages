.SH NAME
WebTransport.closed \- WebTransport: closed property
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f[B]Secure context:\f[R] This feature is available only in secure
contexts (HTTPS).
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R] This feature is available in Web Workers.
.PP
The \f[B]\f[CB]closed\f[B]\f[R] read\-only property of the
\f[CR]WebTransport\f[R] interface returns a promise that resolves when
the transport is closed.
.PP
This promise is created when the \f[CR]WebTransport\f[R] object is
created and is resolved when the transport is closed in any way, such as
by calling the \f[CR]close()\f[R] method, when the connection failed, or
when the connection is closed by the server.
Accessing or awaiting this promise does not trigger any action; it only
allows actions to be taken when the transport is closed, similar to
listening to an event.
.SH VALUE
A \f[CR]Promise\f[R] that resolves to an object containing the following
properties:
.TP
\f[B]closeCode\f[R]
A number representing the error code for the error.
.TP
\f[B]reason\f[R]
A string representing the reason for closing the
\f[CR]WebTransport\f[R].
.PP
Or, in the case of an unexpected closure, such as network failure, the
promise rejects with an error.
.SH EXAMPLES
.IP
.EX
\f[B]const\f[R] url = \(dqhttps://example.com:4999/wt\(dq;

\f[B]async\f[R] \f[B]function\f[R] initTransport(url) {
  \f[I]// Initialize transport connection\f[R]
  \f[B]const\f[R] transport = \f[B]new\f[R] WebTransport(url);

  \f[I]// The connection can be used once ready fulfills\f[R]
  \f[B]await\f[R] transport.ready;

  \f[I]// \&...\f[R]
}

\f[I]// \&...\f[R]

\f[B]async\f[R] \f[B]function\f[R] closeTransport(transport) {
  \f[I]// Respond to connection closing\f[R]
  \f[B]try\f[R] {
    \f[B]await\f[R] transport.closed;
    console.log(\(gaThe HTTP/3 connection to ${url} closed gracefully.\(ga);
  } \f[B]catch\f[R] (error) {
    console.error(\(gaThe HTTP/3 connection to ${url} closed due to ${error}.\(ga);
  }
}
