.SH NAME
ConvolverNode.buffer \- ConvolverNode: buffer property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]buffer\f[B]\f[R] property of the \f[CR]ConvolverNode\f[R]
interface represents a mono, stereo, or 4\-channel
\f[CR]AudioBuffer\f[R] containing the (possibly multichannel) impulse
response used by the \f[CR]ConvolverNode\f[R] to create the reverb
effect.
.PP
This is normally a simple recording of as\-close\-to\-an\-impulse as can
be found in the space you want to model.
For example, if you want to model the reverb in your bathroom, you might
set up a microphone near the door to record the sound of a balloon pop
or synthesized impulse from the sink.
That audio recording could then be used as the buffer.
.PP
This audio buffer must have the same sample\-rate as the
\f[CR]AudioContext\f[R] or an exception will be thrown.
At the time when this attribute is set, the buffer and the state of the
attribute will be used to configure the \f[CR]ConvolverNode\f[R] with
this impulse response having the given normalization.
The initial value of this attribute is \f[CR]null\f[R].
.SH VALUE
An \f[CR]AudioBuffer\f[R].
.SH EXAMPLES
.SS Assigning an audio buffer
The following example creates a convolver node and assigns it an
\f[CR]AudioBuffer\f[R].
