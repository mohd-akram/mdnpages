.SH NAME
HTMLScriptElement.referrerPolicy \- HTMLScriptElement: referrerPolicy
property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]referrerPolicy\f[B]\f[R] property of the
\f[CR]HTMLScriptElement\f[R] interface reflects the HTML
\f[CR]referrerpolicy\f[R] of the \f[CR]<script>\f[R] element, which
defines how the referrer is set when fetching the script and any scripts
it imports.
.SH VALUE
A string; one of the following:
.TP
\f[B]no\-referrer\f[R]
The \f[CR]Referer\f[R] header will be omitted entirely.
No referrer information is sent along with requests.
.TP
\f[B]no\-referrer\-when\-downgrade\f[R]
The URL is sent as a referrer when the protocol security level stays the
same (e.g.HTTP→HTTP, HTTPS→HTTPS), but isn\[cq]t sent to a less secure
destination (e.g.\ HTTPS→HTTP).
.TP
\f[B]origin\f[R]
Only send the origin of the document as the referrer in all cases.
The document \f[CR]https://example.com/page.html\f[R] will send the
referrer \f[CR]https://example.com/\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]origin\-when\-cross\-origin\f[R]
Send a full URL when performing a same\-origin request, but only send
the origin of the document for other cases.
.TP
\f[B]same\-origin\f[R]
A referrer will be sent for same\-site origins, but cross\-origin
requests will contain no referrer information.
.TP
\f[B]strict\-origin\f[R]
Only send the origin of the document as the referrer when the protocol
security level stays the same (e.g.\ HTTPS→HTTPS), but don\[cq]t send it
to a less secure destination (e.g.\ HTTPS→HTTP).
.TP
\f[B]strict\-origin\-when\-cross\-origin\f[R] (default)
This is the user agent\[cq]s default behavior if no policy is specified.
Send a full URL when performing a same\-origin request, only send the
origin when the protocol security level stays the same
(e.g.\ HTTPS→HTTPS), and send no header to a less secure destination
(e.g.\ HTTPS→HTTP).
.TP
\f[B]unsafe\-url\f[R]
Send a full URL when performing a same\-origin or cross\-origin request.
This policy will leak origins and paths from TLS\-protected resources to
insecure origins.
Carefully consider the impact of this setting.
.RS
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R] An empty string value (\f[CR]\[dq]\[dq]\f[R]) is both
the default value, and a fallback value if \f[CR]referrerpolicy\f[R] is
not supported.
If \f[CR]referrerpolicy\f[R] is not explicitly specified on the
\f[CR]<script>\f[R] element, it will adopt a higher\-level referrer
policy, i.e.\ one set on the whole document or domain.
If a higher\-level policy is not available, the empty string is treated
as being equivalent to \f[CR]no\-referrer\-when\-downgrade\f[R].
