.SH NAME
PerformanceNavigationTiming \- PerformanceNavigationTiming
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]PerformanceNavigationTiming\f[B]\f[R] interface provides
methods and properties to store and retrieve metrics regarding the
browser\(cqs document navigation events.
For example, this interface can be used to determine how much time it
takes to load or unload a document.
.PP
Only the current document is included in the performance timeline, so
there is only one \f[CR]PerformanceNavigationTiming\f[R] object in the
performance timeline.
It inherits all of the properties and methods of
\f[CR]PerformanceResourceTiming\f[R] and \f[CR]PerformanceEntry\f[R].
.PP
The following diagram shows all of the timestamp properties defined in
\f[CR]PerformanceNavigationTiming\f[R].

.SH INSTANCE PROPERTIES
This interface extends the following \f[CR]PerformanceEntry\f[R]
properties by qualifying and constraining them as follows:
.TP
\f[B]PerformanceEntry.entryType\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
Returns \f[CR]\(dqnavigation\(dq\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]PerformanceEntry.name\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
Returns the document\(cqs URL.
Note that text fragments, and any other fragment directives, are
stripped from the URL.
.TP
\f[B]PerformanceEntry.startTime\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
Returns a \f[CR]DOMHighResTimeStamp\f[R] with a value of \f[CR]0\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]PerformanceEntry.duration\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
Returns a \f[CR]timestamp\f[R] that is the difference between the
\f[CR]PerformanceNavigationTiming.loadEventEnd\f[R] and
\f[CR]PerformanceEntry.startTime\f[R] properties.
.PP
This interface also extends the following
\f[CR]PerformanceResourceTiming\f[R] properties by qualifying and
constraining them as follows:
.TP
\f[B]PerformanceResourceTiming.initiatorType\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
Returns \f[CR]\(dqnavigation\(dq\f[R].
.PP
The interface also supports the following properties:
.TP
\f[B]PerformanceNavigationTiming.activationStart\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R] \f[I](experimental)\f[R]
A \f[CR]DOMHighResTimeStamp\f[R] representing the time between when a
document starts prerendering and when it is activated.
.TP
\f[B]PerformanceNavigationTiming.criticalCHRestart\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R] \f[I](experimental)\f[R]
A \f[CR]DOMHighResTimeStamp\f[R] representing the time at which the
connection restart occurred due to \f[CR]Critical\-CH\f[R] HTTP response
header mismatch.
.TP
\f[B]PerformanceNavigationTiming.domComplete\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
A \f[CR]DOMHighResTimeStamp\f[R] representing the time immediately
before the user agent sets the document\(cqs \f[CR]readyState\f[R] to
\f[CR]\(dqcomplete\(dq\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]PerformanceNavigationTiming.domContentLoadedEventEnd\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
A \f[CR]DOMHighResTimeStamp\f[R] representing the time immediately after
the current document\(cqs \f[CR]DOMContentLoaded\f[R] event handler
completes.
.TP
\f[B]PerformanceNavigationTiming.domContentLoadedEventStart\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
A \f[CR]DOMHighResTimeStamp\f[R] representing the time immediately
before the current document\(cqs \f[CR]DOMContentLoaded\f[R] event
handler starts.
.TP
\f[B]PerformanceNavigationTiming.domInteractive\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
A \f[CR]DOMHighResTimeStamp\f[R] representing the time immediately
before the user agent sets the document\(cqs \f[CR]readyState\f[R] to
\f[CR]\(dqinteractive\(dq\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]PerformanceNavigationTiming.loadEventEnd\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
A \f[CR]DOMHighResTimeStamp\f[R] representing the time immediately after
the current document\(cqs \f[CR]load\f[R] event handler completes.
.TP
\f[B]PerformanceNavigationTiming.loadEventStart\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
A \f[CR]DOMHighResTimeStamp\f[R] representing the time immediately
before the current document\(cqs \f[CR]load\f[R] event handler starts.
.TP
\f[B]PerformanceNavigationTiming.notRestoredReasons\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R] \f[I](experimental)\f[R]
A \f[CR]NotRestoredReasons\f[R] object providing report data on reasons
why the current document was blocked from using the back/forward cache
(bfcache) on navigation.
.TP
\f[B]PerformanceNavigationTiming.redirectCount\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
A number representing the number of redirects since the last
non\-redirect navigation in the current browsing context.
.TP
\f[B]PerformanceNavigationTiming.type\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
A string representing the navigation type.
Either \f[CR]\(dqnavigate\(dq\f[R], \f[CR]\(dqreload\(dq\f[R],
\f[CR]\(dqback_forward\(dq\f[R] or \f[CR]\(dqprerender\(dq\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]PerformanceNavigationTiming.unloadEventEnd\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
A \f[CR]DOMHighResTimeStamp\f[R] representing the time immediately after
