.SH NAME
Event.timeStamp \- Event: timeStamp property
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f[B]Note:\f[R] This feature is available in Web Workers.
.PP
The \f[B]\f[CB]timeStamp\f[B]\f[R] read\-only property of the
\f[CR]Event\f[R] interface returns the time (in milliseconds) at which
the event was created.
.SH VALUE
This value is the number of milliseconds elapsed from the beginning of
the time origin until the event was created.
If the global object is \f[CR]Window\f[R], the time origin is the moment
the user clicked on the link, or the script that initiated the loading
of the document.
In a worker, the time origin is the moment of creation of the worker.
.PP
The value is a \f[CR]DOMHighResTimeStamp\f[R] accurate to 5 microseconds
(0.005 ms), but the precision is reduced to prevent fingerprinting.
.SH EXAMPLE
.SS HTML

.EX
<\f[B]p\f[R]>
  Focus this iframe and press any key to get the current timestamp for the
  keypress event.
</\f[B]p\f[R]>
<\f[B]p\f[R]>timeStamp: <\f[B]span\f[R] id=\[dq]time\[dq]>\-</\f[B]span\f[R]></\f[B]p\f[R]>

.EX
\f[B]function\f[R] getTime(event) {
  \f[B]const\f[R] time = document.getElementById(\[dq]time\[dq]);
  time.firstChild.nodeValue = event.timeStamp;
}
document.body.addEventListener(\[dq]keypress\[dq], getTime);
.EE
.SS Result
.SH REDUCED TIME PRECISION
To offer protection against timing attacks and fingerprinting, the
precision of \f[CR]event.timeStamp\f[R] might get rounded depending on
browser settings.
In Firefox, the \f[CR]privacy.reduceTimerPrecision\f[R] preference is
enabled by default and defaults to 2ms.
You can also enable \f[CR]privacy.resistFingerprinting\f[R], in which
case the precision will be 100ms or the value of
\f[CR]privacy.resistFingerprinting.reduceTimerPrecision.microseconds\f[R],
whichever is larger.
.PP
For example, with reduced time precision, the result of
\f[CR]event.timeStamp\f[R] will always be a multiple of 2, or a multiple
of 100 (or
\f[CR]privacy.resistFingerprinting.reduceTimerPrecision.microseconds\f[R])
with \f[CR]privacy.resistFingerprinting\f[R] enabled.
