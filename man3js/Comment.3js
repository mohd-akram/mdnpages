.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]Comment\f[B]\f[R] interface represents textual notations
within markup; although it is generally not visually shown, such
comments are available to be read in the source view.
.PP
Comments are represented in HTML and XML as content between
`\f[CR]<!\-\-\f[R]' and `\f[CR]\-\->\f[R]'.
In XML, like inside SVG or MathML markup, the character sequence
`\f[CR]\-\-\f[R]' cannot be used within a comment.
