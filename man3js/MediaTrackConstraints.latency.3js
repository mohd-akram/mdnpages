.SH NAME
MediaTrackConstraints.latency \- MediaTrackConstraints: latency property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[CR]MediaTrackConstraints\f[R] dictionary\[cq]s
\f[B]\f[CB]latency\f[B]\f[R] property is a \f[CR]ConstrainDouble\f[R]
describing the requested or mandatory constraints placed upon the value
of the \f[CR]latency\f[R] constrainable property.
.PP
If needed, you can determine whether or not this constraint is supported
by checking the value of
\f[CR]MediaTrackSupportedConstraints.latency\f[R] as returned by a call
to \f[CR]MediaDevices.getSupportedConstraints()\f[R].
However, typically this is unnecessary since browsers will ignore any
constraints they\[cq]re unfamiliar with.
.PP
Because RTP doesn\[cq]t include this information, tracks associated with
a WebRTC \f[CR]RTCPeerConnection\f[R] will never include this property.
.SH VALUE
A \f[CR]ConstrainDouble\f[R] describing the acceptable or required
value(s) for an audio track\[cq]s latency, with values specified in
seconds.
In audio processing, latency is the time between the start of processing
(when sound occurs in the real world, or is generated by a hardware
device) and the data being made available to the next step in the audio
input or output process.
In most cases, low latency is desirable for performance and user
experience purposes, but when power consumption is a concern, or delays
are otherwise acceptable, higher latency might be acceptable.
.PP
If this property\[cq]s value is a number, the user agent will attempt to
obtain media whose latency tends to be as close as possible to this
number given the capabilities of the hardware and the other constraints
specified.
Otherwise, the value of this \f[CR]ConstrainDouble\f[R] will guide the
user agent in its efforts to provide an exact match to the required
latency (if \f[CR]exact\f[R] is specified or both \f[CR]min\f[R] and
\f[CR]max\f[R] are provided and have the same value) or to a
best\-possible value.
.RS
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R] Latency is always prone to some variation due to
hardware usage demands, network constraints, and so forth, so even in an
\[lq]exact\[rq] match, some variation should be expected.
