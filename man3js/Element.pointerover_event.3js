.SH NAME
Element.pointerover_event \- Element: pointerover event
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[CR]pointerover\f[R] event is fired when a pointing device is
moved into an element\(cqs hit test boundaries.
.PP
\f[CR]pointerover\f[R] events have the same problems as
\f[CR]mouseover\f[R].
If the target element has child elements, \f[CR]pointerout\f[R] and
\f[CR]pointerover\f[R] events fire as the pointer moves over the
boundaries of these elements too, not just the target element itself.
Usually, \f[CR]pointerenter\f[R] and \f[CR]pointerleave\f[R] events\(cq
behavior is more sensible, because they are not affected by moving into
child elements.
.SH SYNTAX
Use the event name in methods like \f[CR]addEventListener()\f[R], or set
an event handler property.

addEventListener(\(dqpointerover\(dq, (event) => { })

.SH EVENT TYPE
A \f[CR]PointerEvent\f[R].
Inherits from \f[CR]Event\f[R].
.SH EVENT PROPERTIES
\f[I]This interface inherits properties from \f[CI]MouseEvent\f[I] and
\f[CI]Event\f[I].\f[R]
.TP
\f[B]PointerEvent.altitudeAngle\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R] \f[I](experimental)\f[R]
Represents the angle between a transducer (a pointer or stylus) axis and
the X\-Y plane of a device screen.
.TP
\f[B]PointerEvent.azimuthAngle\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R] \f[I](experimental)\f[R]
Represents the angle between the Y\-Z plane and the plane containing
both the transducer (a pointer or stylus) axis and the Y axis.
.TP
\f[B]PointerEvent.persistentDeviceId\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R] \f[I](experimental)\f[R]
A unique identifier for the pointing device generating the
\f[CR]PointerEvent\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]PointerEvent.pointerId\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
A unique identifier for the pointer causing the event.
.TP
\f[B]PointerEvent.width\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
The width (magnitude on the X axis), in CSS pixels, of the contact
geometry of the pointer.
.TP
\f[B]PointerEvent.height\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
The height (magnitude on the Y axis), in CSS pixels, of the contact
geometry of the pointer.
.TP
\f[B]PointerEvent.pressure\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
The normalized pressure of the pointer input in the range \f[CR]0\f[R]
to \f[CR]1\f[R], where \f[CR]0\f[R] and \f[CR]1\f[R] represent the
minimum and maximum pressure the hardware is capable of detecting,
respectively.
.TP
\f[B]PointerEvent.tangentialPressure\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
The normalized tangential pressure of the pointer input (also known as
barrel pressure or \c
.UR https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylinder_stress
cylinder stress
.UE \c
) in the range \f[CR]\-1\f[R] to \f[CR]1\f[R], where \f[CR]0\f[R] is the
neutral position of the control.
.TP
\f[B]PointerEvent.tiltX\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
The plane angle (in degrees, in the range of \f[CR]\-90\f[R] to
\f[CR]90\f[R]) between the Y\(enZ plane and the plane containing both
the pointer (e.g., pen stylus) axis and the Y axis.
.TP
\f[B]PointerEvent.tiltY\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
The plane angle (in degrees, in the range of \f[CR]\-90\f[R] to
\f[CR]90\f[R]) between the X\(enZ plane and the plane containing both
the pointer (e.g., pen stylus) axis and the X axis.
.TP
\f[B]PointerEvent.twist\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
The clockwise rotation of the pointer (e.g., pen stylus) around its
major axis in degrees, with a value in the range \f[CR]0\f[R] to
\f[CR]359\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]PointerEvent.pointerType\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
Indicates the device type that caused the event (mouse, pen, touch,
etc.).
.TP
\f[B]PointerEvent.isPrimary\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
Indicates if the pointer represents the primary pointer of this pointer
type.
.SH EXAMPLES
Using \f[CR]addEventListener()\f[R]:
.IP
.EX
\f[B]const\f[R] para = document.querySelector(\(dqp\(dq);

para.addEventListener(\(dqpointerover\(dq, (event) \f[B]=>\f[R] {
  console.log(\(dqPointer moved in\(dq);
});
.EE
.PP
Using the \f[CR]onpointerover\f[R] event handler property:
.IP
.EX
\f[B]const\f[R] para = document.querySelector(\(dqp\(dq);

para.onpointerover = (event) \f[B]=>\f[R] {
  console.log(\(dqPointer moved in\(dq);
};
