.SH NAME
RTCIceCandidate.sdpMLineIndex \- RTCIceCandidate: sdpMLineIndex property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The read\-only \f[B]\f[CB]sdpMLineIndex\f[B]\f[R] property on the
\f[CR]RTCIceCandidate\f[R] interface is a zero\-based index of the
m\-line describing the media associated with the candidate.
.PP
This property can be configured by specifying the value of the
\f[CR]sdpMLineIndex\f[R] property in the \f[CR]candidateInfo\f[R]
options object that is passed to the \f[CR]RTCIceCandidate()\f[R]
constructor.
If you call the constructor with an m\-line string instead of the
options object, the value of \f[CR]sdpMLineIndex\f[R] is extracted from
the specified candidate m\-line string.
.SH VALUE
A number containing a 0\-based index into the set of m\-lines providing
media descriptions, indicating which media source is associated with the
candidate, or \f[CR]null\f[R] if no such association is available.
.RS
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R] Attempting to add a candidate (using
\f[CR]addIceCandidate()\f[R]) that has a value of \f[CR]null\f[R] for
either \f[CR]sdpMid\f[R] or \f[CR]sdpMLineIndex\f[R] will throw a
\f[CR]TypeError\f[R] exception.
