.SH NAME
AudioData \- AudioData
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f[B]Note:\f[R] This feature is available in Dedicated Web Workers.
.PP
The \f[B]\f[CB]AudioData\f[B]\f[R] interface of the WebCodecs API
represents an audio sample.
.PP
\f[CR]AudioData\f[R] is a transferable object.
.SH DESCRIPTION
An audio track consists of a stream of audio samples, each sample
representing a captured moment of sound.
An \f[CR]AudioData\f[R] object is a representation of such a sample.
Working alongside the interfaces of the Insertable Streams API, you can
break a stream into individual \f[CR]AudioData\f[R] objects with
\f[CR]MediaStreamTrackProcessor\f[R], or construct an audio track from a
stream of frames with \f[CR]MediaStreamTrackGenerator\f[R].

.RE
.SS The media resource
An \f[CR]AudioData\f[R] object contains a reference to an attached
\f[B]media resource\f[R].
This media resource contains the actual audio sample data described by
the object.
A media resource is maintained by the user agent until it is no longer
referenced by an \f[CR]AudioData\f[R] object, for example when
\f[CR]AudioData.close()\f[R] is called.
.SS Planes and audio format
To return the sample format of an \f[CR]AudioData\f[R] use the
\f[CR]AudioData.format\f[R] property.
The format may be described as \f[B]interleaved\f[R] or
\f[B]planar\f[R].
In interleaved formats, the audio samples from the different channels
are laid out in a single buffer, described as a \f[B]plane\f[R].
This plane contains a number of elements equal to
\f[CR]AudioData.numberOfFrames\f[R] *
\f[CR]AudioData.numberOfChannels\f[R].
.PP
In planar format, the number of planes is equal to
\f[CR]AudioData.numberOfChannels\f[R], and each plane is a buffer
containing a number of elements equal to
\f[CR]AudioData.numberOfFrames\f[R].
.SH CONSTRUCTOR
.TP
\f[B]AudioData()\f[R]
Creates a new \f[CR]AudioData\f[R] object.
.SH INSTANCE PROPERTIES

\f[B]AudioData.format\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
Returns the sample format of the audio.
.TP
\f[B]AudioData.sampleRate\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
Returns the sample rate of the audio in Hz.
.TP
\f[B]AudioData.numberOfFrames\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
Returns the number of frames.
.TP
\f[B]AudioData.numberOfChannels\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
Returns the number of audio channels.
.TP
\f[B]AudioData.duration\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
Returns the duration of the audio in microseconds.
.TP
\f[B]AudioData.timestamp\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
Returns the timestamp of the audio in microseconds.
.SH INSTANCE METHODS
.TP
\f[B]AudioData.allocationSize()\f[R]
Returns the number of bytes required to hold the sample as filtered by
options passed into the method.
.TP
\f[B]AudioData.copyTo()\f[R]
Copies the samples from the specified plane of the \f[CR]AudioData\f[R]
object to the destination.
.TP
\f[B]AudioData.clone()\f[R]
Creates a new \f[CR]AudioData\f[R] object with reference to the same
media resource as the original.
.TP
\f[B]AudioData.close()\f[R]
Clears all states and releases the reference to the media resource.
