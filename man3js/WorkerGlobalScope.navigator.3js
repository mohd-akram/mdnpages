.SH NAME
WorkerGlobalScope.navigator \- WorkerGlobalScope: navigator property
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f[B]Note:\f[R] This feature is only available in Web Workers.
.PP
The \f[B]\f[CB]navigator\f[B]\f[R] read\-only property of the
\f[CR]WorkerGlobalScope\f[R] interface returns the
\f[CR]WorkerNavigator\f[R] associated with the worker.
It is a specific navigator object, mostly a subset of the
\f[CR]Navigator\f[R] for browsing scopes, but adapted to workers.
.SH VALUE
A \f[CR]WorkerNavigator\f[R] object.
.SH EXAMPLES
If you call the following
.IP
.EX
console.log(navigator);
.EE
.PP
inside a worker (which would basically be the equivalent of
\f[CR]self.console.log(self.navigator);\f[R], as these are being called
on the worker scope, which can be referenced with
\f[CR]WorkerGlobalScope.self\f[R]), you will get a
\f[CR]WorkerNavigator\f[R] object written to the console \[em] something
like the following:
.IP
.EX
Object {onLine: true, userAgent: \[dq]Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_10_1) Ap\&...ML, like Gecko) Chrome/40.0.2214.93 Safari/537.36\[dq], product: \[dq]Gecko\[dq], platform: \[dq]MacIntel\[dq], appVersion: \[dq]5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_10_1) AppleWebKi\&...ML, like Gecko) Chrome/40.0.2214.93 Safari/537.36\[dq]\&...}

    __proto__: Object
.EE
.PP
You could use this navigator object to return more information about the
runtime environment, as you might do with a normal \f[CR]Navigator\f[R]
object.
