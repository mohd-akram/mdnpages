Gamepad \- Gamepad
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f[B]Secure context:\f[R] This feature is available only in secure
contexts (HTTPS).
.PP
The \f[B]\f[CB]Gamepad\f[B]\f[R] interface of the Gamepad API defines an
individual gamepad or other controller, allowing access to information
such as button presses, axis positions, and id.
.PP
A Gamepad object can be returned in one of two ways: via the
\f[CR]gamepad\f[R] property of the \f[CR]gamepadconnected\f[R] and
\f[CR]gamepaddisconnected\f[R] events, or by grabbing any position in
the array returned by the \f[CR]Navigator.getGamepads()\f[R] method.
.RS
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R] The support of gamepad features varies across different
combinations of platforms and controllers.
Even if the controller supports a certain feature (for example, haptic
feedback), the platform may not support it for that controller.
