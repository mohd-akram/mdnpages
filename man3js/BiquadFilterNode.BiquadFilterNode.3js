BiquadFilterNode() constructor
.SH SYNOPSIS

\f[B]context\f[R]

.TP
\f[B]options\f[R] \f[I](optional)\f[R]
An object with the following properties:
.RS
.TP
\f[B]type\f[R]
One of the following strings.
The meaning of the other options depends on the value of
\f[CR]type\f[R].
.RS
.TP
\f[B]lowpass\f[R]
The default.
Allows frequencies below a cutoff frequency to pass through, and
attenuates frequencies above the cutoff.
This is a standard second\-order resonant lowpass filter with
12dB/octave rolloff.
With this type of filter, the meaning of the other options are as
follows:
.RS
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]Q\f[R]: controls how peaked the response will be at the cutoff
frequency.
A large value makes the response more peaked.
Please note that for this filter type, this value is not a traditional
Q, but is a resonance value in decibels.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]frequency\f[R]: the cutoff frequency.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]gain\f[R]: not used.
.RE
.TP
\f[B]highpass\f[R]
A highpass filter is the opposite of a lowpass filter.
Frequencies above the cutoff frequency are passed through, but
frequencies below the cutoff are attenuated.
It implements a standard second\-order resonant highpass filter with
12dB/octave rolloff.
With this type of filter, the meaning of the other options are as
follows:
.RS
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]Q\f[R]: controls how peaked the response will be at the cutoff
frequency.
A large value makes the response more peaked.
Please note that for this filter type, this value is not a traditional
Q, but is a resonance value in decibels.

\f[CR]gain\f[R]: not used.
.RE
.TP
\f[B]bandpass\f[R]
A bandpass filter allows a range of frequencies to pass through and
attenuates the frequencies below and above this frequency range.
It implements a second\-order bandpass filter.
With this type of filter, the meaning of the other options are as
follows:
.RS
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]Q\f[R]: controls the width of the band.
The width becomes narrower as the Q value increases.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]frequency\f[R]: the center of the frequency band.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]gain\f[R]: not used.
.RE
.TP
\f[B]lowshelf\f[R]
The lowshelf filter allows all frequencies through, but adds a boost (or
attenuation) to the lower frequencies.
It implements a second\-order lowshelf filter.
With this type of filter, the meaning of the other options are as
follows:
.RS
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]Q\f[R]: not used.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]frequency\f[R]: the upper limit of the frequencies where the
boost, or attenuation, is applied.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]gain\f[R]: the boost, in dB, to be applied.
If the value is negative, the frequencies are attenuated.
.RE
.TP
\f[B]highshelf\f[R]
The highshelf filter is the opposite of the lowshelf filter and allows
all frequencies through, but adds a boost to the higher frequencies.
It implements a second\-order highshelf filter.
With this type of filter, the meaning of the other options are as
follows:
.RS
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]Q\f[R]: not used.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]frequency\f[R]: the lower limit of the frequencies where the
boost, or attenuation, is applied.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]gain\f[R]: the boost, in dB, to be applied.
If the value is negative, the frequencies are attenuated.
.RE
.TP
\f[B]peaking\f[R]
The peaking filter allows all frequencies through, adding a boost, or
attenuation, to a range of frequencies.
With this type of filter, the meaning of the other options are as
follows:
.RS
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]Q\f[R]: the width of the band of frequencies that are boosted.
A large value implies a narrow width.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]frequency\f[R]: the center frequency of the boost range.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]gain\f[R]: the boost, in dB, to be applied.

.TP
\f[B]notch\f[R]
The notch filter (also known as a band\-stop, or band\-rejection filter)
is the opposite of a bandpass filter.
It allows all frequencies through, except for a set of frequencies.
With this type of filter, the meaning of the other options are as
follows:
.RS
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]Q\f[R]: the width of the band of frequencies that are attenuated.

\f[B]allpass\f[R]
An allpass filter allows all frequencies through, but changes the phase
relationship between the various frequencies.
It implements a second\-order allpass filter.
With this type of filter, the meaning of the other options are as
follows:
.RS
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]Q\f[R]: the sharpness of the phase transition at the center
frequency.
A larger value implies a sharper transition and a larger group delay.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]frequency\f[R]: the frequency where the center of the phase
transition occurs.
Viewed another way, this is the frequency with maximal group delay.
.IP \[bu] 2

.TP
\f[B]channelCount\f[R]
Represents an integer used to determine how many channels are used when
up\-mixing and down\-mixing connections to any inputs to the node.
(See \f[CR]AudioNode.channelCount\f[R] for more information.)
Its usage and precise definition depend on the value of
\f[CR]channelCountMode\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]channelCountMode\f[R]

matched between the node\[cq]s inputs and outputs.

including default values.)

\f[B]channelInterpretation\f[R]
Represents an enumerated value describing the meaning of the channels.
This interpretation will define how audio up\-mixing and down\-mixing
will happen.

\f[CR]\[dq]discrete\[dq]\f[R].
