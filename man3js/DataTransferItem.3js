DataTransferItem \- DataTransferItem
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]DataTransferItem\f[B]\f[R] object represents one drag
data item.
During a \f[I]drag operation\f[R], each \f[CR]DragEvent\f[R] has a
\f[CR]dataTransfer\f[R] property which contains a \f[CR]list\f[R] of
drag data items.
Each item in the list is a \f[CR]DataTransferItem\f[R] object.
.PP
\f[CR]DataTransferItem\f[R] was primarily designed for the HTML Drag and
Drop API, and is still specified in the HTML drag\-and\-drop section,
but it is now also used by other APIs, such as
\f[CR]ClipboardEvent.clipboardData\f[R] and
\f[CR]InputEvent.dataTransfer\f[R].
Documentation of \f[CR]DataTransferItem\f[R] will primarily discuss its
usage in drag\-and\-drop operations, and you should refer to the other
APIs\(cq documentation for usage of \f[CR]DataTransferItem\f[R] in those
contexts.
.PP
This interface has no constructor.
