BiquadFilterNode.type \- BiquadFilterNode: type property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[CR]type\f[R] property of the \f[CR]BiquadFilterNode\f[R]
interface is a string (enum) value defining the kind of filtering
algorithm the node is implementing.

Description
frequency
Q
gain
lowpass
Standard second\-order resonant lowpass filter with 12dB/octave rolloff.
Frequencies below the cutoff pass through; frequencies above it are
attenuated.
The cutoff frequency.
Indicates how peaked the frequency is around the cutoff.
The greater the value is, the greater is the peak.
Not used
highpass
Standard second\-order resonant highpass filter with 12dB/octave
rolloff.
Frequencies below the cutoff are attenuated; frequencies above it pass
through.
The cutoff frequency.
Indicates how peaked the frequency is around the cutoff.
The greater the value, the greater the peak.
Not used
bandpass
Standard second\-order bandpass filter.
Frequencies outside the given range of frequencies are attenuated; the
frequencies inside it pass through.
The center of the range of frequencies.
Controls the width of the frequency band.
The greater the Q value, the larger the frequency band.
Not used
lowshelf
Standard second\-order lowshelf filer.
Frequencies lower than the frequency get a boost, or an attenuation;
frequencies over it are unchanged.
The upper limit of the frequencies getting a boost or an attenuation.
Not used
The boost, in dB, to be applied; if negative, it will be an attenuation.
highshelf
Standard second\-order highshelf filer.
Frequencies higher than the frequency get a boost or an attenuation;
frequencies lower than it are unchanged.
The lower limit of the frequencies getting a boost or an attenuation.
Not used
The boost, in dB, to be applied; if negative, it will be an attenuation.
peaking
Frequencies inside the range get a boost or an attenuation; frequencies
outside it are unchanged.
The middle of the frequency range getting a boost or an attenuation.
Controls the width of the frequency band.
The greater the Q value, the larger the frequency band.
The boost, in dB, to be applied; if negative, it will be an attenuation.
notch
Standard notch filter, also called a band\-stop or band\-rejection
filter.
It is the opposite of a bandpass filter: frequencies outside the give
range of frequencies pass through; frequencies inside it are attenuated.
The center of the range of frequencies.
Controls the width of the frequency band.
The greater the Q value, the larger the frequency band.
Not used
allpass
Standard second\-order allpass filter.
It Lets all frequencies through, but changes the phase\-relationship
between the various frequencies.
The frequency with the maximal group delay, that is, the frequency where
the center of the phase transition occurs.
Controls how sharp the transition is at the medium frequency.
The larger this parameter is, the sharper and larger the transition will
be.
Not used
