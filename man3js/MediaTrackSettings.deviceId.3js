.SH NAME
MediaTrackSettings.deviceId \- MediaTrackSettings: deviceId property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[CR]MediaTrackSettings\f[R] dictionary\[cq]s
\f[B]\f[CB]deviceId\f[B]\f[R] property is a string which uniquely
identifies the source for the corresponding \f[CR]MediaStreamTrack\f[R]
for the origin corresponding to the browsing session.
This lets you determine what value was selected to comply with your
specified constraints for this property\[cq]s value as described in the
\f[CR]MediaTrackConstraints.deviceId\f[R] property you provided when
calling either \f[CR]getUserMedia()\f[R].
.PP
If needed, you can determine whether or not this constraint is supported
by checking the value of
\f[CR]MediaTrackSupportedConstraints.deviceId\f[R] as returned by a call
to \f[CR]MediaDevices.getSupportedConstraints()\f[R].
However, typically this is unnecessary since browsers will ignore any
constraints they\[cq]re unfamiliar with.
.PP
Because RTP doesn\[cq]t include this information, tracks associated with
a WebRTC \f[CR]RTCPeerConnection\f[R] will never include this property.
.SH VALUE
A string whose value is an origin\-unique identifier for the track\[cq]s
source.
This ID is valid across multiple browsing sessions for the same origin
and is guaranteed to be different for all other origins, so you can
safely use it to request the same source be used for multiple sessions,
for example.
.PP
The actual value of the string, however, is determined by the source of
the track, and there is no guarantee what form it will take, although
the specification does recommend it be a GUID.
.PP
Since there is a one\-to\-one pairing of ID with each source, all tracks
with the same source will share the same ID for any given origin, so
\f[CR]MediaStreamTrack.getCapabilities()\f[R] will always return exactly
one value for \f[CR]deviceId\f[R].
That makes the device ID not useful for any changes to constraints when
calling \f[CR]MediaStreamTrack.applyConstraints()\f[R].
.RS
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R] An exception to the rule that device IDs are the same
across browsing sessions: private browsing mode will use a different ID,
and will change it each browsing session.
