.SH NAME
HTMLMediaElement.load \- HTMLMediaElement: load() method
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[CR]HTMLMediaElement\f[R] method \f[B]\f[CB]load()\f[B]\f[R]
resets the media element to its initial state and begins the process of
selecting a media source and loading the media in preparation for
playback to begin at the beginning.
.PP
The amount of media data that is prefetched is determined by the value
of the element\(cqs \f[CR]preload\f[R] attribute.
.PP
This method is generally only useful when you\(cqve made dynamic changes
to the set of sources available for the media element, either by
changing the element\(cqs \f[CR]src\f[R] attribute or by adding or
removing \f[CR]<source>\f[R] elements nested within the media element
itself.
\f[CR]load()\f[R] will reset the element and rescan the available
sources, thereby causing the changes to take effect.
.SH SYNTAX
.IP
.EX
load()
.EE
.SS Parameters
None.
.SS Return value
None (\f[CR]undefined\f[R]).
.SH USAGE NOTES
Calling \f[CR]load()\f[R] aborts all ongoing operations involving this
media element, then begins the process of selecting and loading an
appropriate media resource given the options specified in the
\f[CR]<audio>\f[R] or \f[CR]<video>\f[R] element and its \f[CR]src\f[R]
attribute or child \f[CR]<source>\f[R] element(s).
This is described in more detail in the HTML video and audio page.
.PP
The process of aborting any ongoing activities will cause any
outstanding \f[CR]Promise\f[R]s returned by \f[CR]play()\f[R] being
fulfilled or rejected as appropriate based on their status before the
loading of new media can begin.
Pending play promises are aborted with an \f[CR]\(dqAbortError\(dq\f[R]
\f[CR]DOMException\f[R].
.PP
Appropriate events will be sent to the media element itself as the load
process proceeds:
.IP \(bu 2
If the element is already in the process of loading media, that load
process is aborted and the \f[B]\f[CB]abort\f[B]\f[R] event is sent.
.IP \(bu 2
If the element has already been initialized with media, the
\f[B]\f[CB]emptied\f[B]\f[R] event is sent.
.IP \(bu 2
If resetting the playback position to the beginning of the media
actually changes the playback position (that is, it was not already at
the beginning), a \f[B]\f[CB]timeupdate\f[B]\f[R] event is sent.
.IP \(bu 2
Once media has been selected and loading is ready to begin, the
\f[B]\f[CB]loadstart\f[B]\f[R] event is delivered.
.IP \(bu 2
From this point onward, events are sent just like any media load.
.SH EXAMPLES
This example finds a \f[CR]<video>\f[R] element in the document and
resets it by calling \f[CR]load()\f[R].
.IP
.EX
\f[B]const\f[R] mediaElem = document.querySelector(\(dqvideo\(dq);
mediaElem.load();
.EE
