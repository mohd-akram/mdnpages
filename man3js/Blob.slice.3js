.SS Parameters
.TP
\f[B]start\f[R] \f[I](optional)\f[R]
An index into the \f[CR]Blob\f[R] indicating the first byte to include
in the new \f[CR]Blob\f[R].
If you specify a negative value, it\[cq]s treated as an offset from the
end of the \f[CR]Blob\f[R] toward the beginning.
For example, \-10 would be the 10th from last byte in the
\f[CR]Blob\f[R].
The default value is 0.
If you specify a value for \f[CR]start\f[R] that is larger than the size
of the source \f[CR]Blob\f[R], the returned \f[CR]Blob\f[R] has size 0
and contains no data.
.TP
\f[B]end\f[R] \f[I](optional)\f[R]
An index into the \f[CR]Blob\f[R] indicating the first byte that will
\f[I]not\f[R] be included in the new \f[CR]Blob\f[R] (i.e.\ the byte
exactly at this index is not included).
If you specify a negative value, it\[cq]s treated as an offset from the
end of the \f[CR]Blob\f[R] toward the beginning.
For example, \-10 would be the 10th from last byte in the
\f[CR]Blob\f[R].
The default value is \f[CR]size\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]contentType\f[R] \f[I](optional)\f[R]
The content type to assign to the new \f[CR]Blob\f[R]; this will be the
value of its \f[CR]type\f[R] property.
The default value is an empty string.
.SS Return value
A new \f[CR]Blob\f[R] object containing the specified subset of the data
contained within the blob on which this method was called.
The original blob is not altered.
