.SH NAME
AudioBufferSourceNode.AudioBufferSourceNode \- AudioBufferSourceNode:
AudioBufferSourceNode() constructor
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]AudioBufferSourceNode()\f[B]\f[R] constructor creates a
new \f[CR]AudioBufferSourceNode\f[R] object instance.
.SH SYNTAX
.IP
.EX
new AudioBufferSourceNode(context, options)
.EE
.SS Parameters
.TP
\f[B]context\f[R]
A reference to an \f[CR]AudioContext\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]options\f[R] \f[I](optional)\f[R]
Options are as follows:
.RS
.TP
\f[B]buffer\f[R]
An instance of \f[CR]AudioBuffer\f[R] to be played.
.TP
\f[B]detune\f[R]
A value in cents to modulate the speed of audio stream rendering.
Its nominal range is (\-∞ to +∞).
The default is \f[CR]0\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]loop\f[R]
A boolean indicating whether the audio should play in a loop.
The default is \f[CR]false\f[R].
If the loop is dynamically modified during playback, the new value will
take effect on the next processing block of audio.
.TP
\f[B]loopEnd\f[R]
An optional value, in seconds, where looping should end if the loop
attribute is \f[CR]true\f[R].
The default is \f[CR]0\f[R].
Its value is exclusive to the content of the loop.
The sample frames, comprising the loop, run from the values
\f[CR]loopStart\f[R] to \f[CR]loopEnd\f[R]\-(1/\f[CR]sampleRate\f[R]).
It\[cq]s sensible to set this to a value between 0 and the duration of
the buffer.
If \f[CR]loopEnd\f[R] is less than 0, looping will end at 0.
If \f[CR]loopEnd\f[R] is greater than the duration of the buffer,
looping will end at the end of the buffer.
This attribute is converted to an exact sample frame offset within the
buffer, by multiplying by the buffer\[cq]s sample rate and rounding to
the nearest integer value.
Thus, its behavior is independent of the value of the
\f[CR]playbackRate\f[R] parameter.
.TP
\f[B]loopStart\f[R]
An optional value in seconds, where looping should begin if the loop
attribute is \f[CR]true\f[R].
The default is \f[CR]0\f[R].
It\[cq]s sensible to set this to a value between 0 and the duration of
the buffer.
If \f[CR]loopStart\f[R] is less than 0, looping will begin at 0.
If \f[CR]loopStart\f[R] is greater than the duration of the buffer,
looping will begin at the end of the buffer.
This attribute is converted to an exact sample frame offset within the
buffer, by multiplying by the buffer\[cq]s sample rate and rounding to
the nearest integer value.
Thus, its behavior is independent of the value of the
\f[CR]playbackRate\f[R] parameter.
.TP
\f[B]playbackRate\f[R]
The speed at which to render the audio stream.
Its default value is \f[CR]1\f[R].
This parameter is k\-rate.
This is a compound parameter with detune.
Its nominal range is (\-∞ to +∞).
.TP
\f[B]channelCount\f[R]
Represents an integer used to determine how many channels are used when
up\-mixing and down\-mixing connections to any inputs to the node.
(See \f[CR]AudioNode.channelCount\f[R] for more information.)
Its usage and precise definition depend on the value of
\f[CR]channelCountMode\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]channelCountMode\f[R]
Represents an enumerated value describing the way channels must be
matched between the node\[cq]s inputs and outputs.
(See \f[CR]AudioNode.channelCountMode\f[R] for more information
including default values.)
.TP
\f[B]channelInterpretation\f[R]
Represents an enumerated value describing the meaning of the channels.
This interpretation will define how audio up\-mixing and down\-mixing
will happen.
The possible values are \f[CR]\[dq]speakers\[dq]\f[R] or
\f[CR]\[dq]discrete\[dq]\f[R].
(See \f[CR]AudioNode.channelCountMode\f[R] for more information
including default values.)
.RE
.SS Return value
A new \f[CR]AudioBufferSourceNode\f[R] object instance.
