.SH NAME
MediaStreamTrack.ended_event \- MediaStreamTrack: ended event
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]ended\f[B]\f[R] event of the \f[CR]MediaStreamTrack\f[R]
interface is fired when playback or streaming has stopped because the
end of the media was reached or because no further data is available.
.PP
This event is not cancelable and does not bubble.
.SH SYNTAX
Use the event name in methods like \f[CR]addEventListener()\f[R], or set
an event handler property.
.IP
.EX
addEventListener(\[dq]ended\[dq], (event) \f[B]=>\f[R] {});

onended = (event) \f[B]=>\f[R] {};
.EE
.SH EVENT TYPE
A generic \f[CR]Event\f[R].
.SH USAGE NOTES
\f[CR]ended\f[R] events fire when the media stream track\[cq]s source
permanently stops sending data on the stream.
There are various ways this can happen, including:
.IP \[bu] 2
There is no more data left to send.
.IP \[bu] 2
The user revoked the permissions needed for the data to be sent.
.IP \[bu] 2
The hardware generating the source data has been removed or ejected.
.IP \[bu] 2
A remote peer has permanently stopped sending data.
.IP \[bu] 2
The only case where the track ends but the \f[CR]ended\f[R] event is not
fired is when calling \f[CR]MediaStreamTrack.stop\f[R].
.PP
Pausing media \f[I]does not\f[R] generate an \f[CR]ended\f[R] event.
.SH EXAMPLES
This example sets up an event handler for the \f[CR]ended\f[R] event,
which changes an on\-screen icon to indicate that the track is no longer
active.
.IP
.EX
track.addEventListener(\[dq]ended\[dq], () \f[B]=>\f[R] {
  \f[B]let\f[R] statusElem = document.getElementById(\[dq]status\-icon\[dq]);
  statusElem.src = \[dq]/images/stopped\-icon.png\[dq];
});
.EE
.PP
You can also set up the event handler using the \f[CR]onended\f[R]
property:
.IP
.EX
track.onended = () \f[B]=>\f[R] {
  \f[B]let\f[R] statusElem = document.getElementById(\[dq]status\-icon\[dq]);

  statusElem.src = \[dq]/images/stopped\-icon.png\[dq];
};
