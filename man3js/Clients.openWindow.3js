.SH NAME
Clients.openWindow \- Clients: openWindow() method
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f[B]Note:\f[R] This feature is only available in Service Workers.
.PP
The \f[B]\f[CB]openWindow()\f[B]\f[R] method of the \f[CR]Clients\f[R]
interface creates a new top level browsing context and loads a given
URL.
If the calling script doesn\(cqt have permission to show popups,
\f[CR]openWindow()\f[R] will throw an \f[CR]InvalidAccessError\f[R].
.PP
In Firefox, the method is allowed to show popups only when called as the
result of a notification click event.
.PP
In Chrome for Android, the method may instead open the URL in an
existing browsing context provided by a standalone web app previously
added to the user\(cqs home screen.
As of recently, this also works on Chrome for Windows.
