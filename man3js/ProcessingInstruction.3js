.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]ProcessingInstruction\f[B]\f[R] interface represents a \c
.UR https://www.w3.org/TR/xml/#sec-pi
processing instruction
.UE \c
; that is, a \f[CR]Node\f[R] which embeds an instruction targeting a
specific application but that can be ignored by any other applications
which don\[cq]t recognize the instruction.

\f[B]Warning:\f[R] \f[CR]ProcessingInstruction\f[R] nodes are only
supported in XML documents, not in HTML documents.
In these, a process instruction will be considered as a comment and be
represented as a \f[CR]Comment\f[R] object in the tree.

A processing instruction may be different than the XML declaration.

\f[B]Note:\f[R] User\-defined processing instructions cannot begin with
\[lq]\f[CR]xml\f[R]\[rq], as \f[CR]xml\f[R]\-prefixed
processing\-instruction target names are reserved by the XML
specification for particular, standard uses (see, for example,
\f[CR]<?xml\-stylesheet ?>\f[R].

For example:
.IP
.EX
\f[B]<?xml\f[R] version=\[dq]1.0\[dq]\f[B]?>\f[R]
.EE

is a processing instruction whose \f[CR]target\f[R] is \f[CR]xml\f[R].
.SH INSTANCE PROPERTIES
\f[I]This interface also inherits properties from its parent interfaces,
\f[CI]CharacterData\f[I], \f[CI]Node\f[I], and
\f[CI]EventTarget\f[I].\f[R]
.TP
\f[B]ProcessingInstruction.sheet\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
Returns the associated \f[CR]StyleSheet\f[R] object, if any; or
\f[CR]null\f[R] if none.
.TP
\f[B]ProcessingInstruction.target\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
A name identifying the application to which the instruction is targeted.
.SH INSTANCE METHODS
\f[I]This interface doesn\[cq]t have any specific method, but inherits
methods from its parent interfaces, \f[CI]CharacterData\f[I],
\f[CI]Node\f[I], and \f[CI]EventTarget\f[I].\f[R]
