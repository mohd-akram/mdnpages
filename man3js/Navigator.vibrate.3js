.SH NAME
Navigator.vibrate \- Navigator: vibrate() method
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]vibrate()\f[B]\f[R] method of the \f[CR]Navigator\f[R]
interface pulses the vibration hardware on the device, if such hardware
exists.
If the device doesn\[cq]t support vibration, this method has no effect.
If a vibration pattern is already in progress when this method is
called, the previous pattern is halted and the new one begins instead.
.PP
If the method was unable to vibrate because of invalid parameters, it
will return \f[CR]false\f[R], else it returns \f[CR]true\f[R].
If the pattern leads to a too long vibration, it is truncated: the max
length depends on the implementation.

.SS Parameters
.TP
\f[B]pattern\f[R]
Provides a pattern of vibration and pause intervals.
Each value indicates a number of milliseconds to vibrate or pause, in
alternation.
You may provide either a single value (to vibrate once for that many
milliseconds) or an array of values to alternately vibrate, pause, then
vibrate again.
See Vibration API for details.
.PP
Passing a value of \f[CR]0\f[R], an empty array, or an array containing
all zeros will cancel any currently ongoing vibration pattern.
.SS Return value
A boolean.
.SH SECURITY
Sticky user activation is required.
The user has to interact with the page or a UI element in order for this
feature to work.
.SH EXAMPLES

.EX
navigator.vibrate(200); \f[I]// vibrate for 200ms\f[R]
