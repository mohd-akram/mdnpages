.SH NAME
AnimationEffect.getComputedTiming \- AnimationEffect:
getComputedTiming() method
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[CR]getComputedTiming()\f[R] method of the
\f[CR]AnimationEffect\f[R] interface returns the calculated timing
properties for this animation effect.
.RS
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R] These values are comparable to the computed styles of an
Element returned using \f[CR]window.getComputedStyle(elem)\f[R].

.SH SYNTAX

.EX
getComputedTiming()
.EE
.SS Parameters
None.
.SS Return value
An object which contains:
.IP \[bu] 2
all of the properties of the object returned by
\f[CR]AnimationEffect.getTiming()\f[R], except that any
\f[CR]\[dq]auto\[dq]\f[R] values are replaced by computed values that
may depend on the type of \f[CR]AnimationEffect\f[R].
.IP \[bu] 2
the following additional properties:
.RS 2
.TP
\f[B]endTime\f[R]
A \f[CR]number\f[R] indicating the end time of the effect in
milliseconds from the effect\[cq]s start.
This is equal to \f[CR]activeDuration\f[R] plus \f[CR]delay\f[R] and
\f[CR]endDelay\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]activeDuration\f[R]
A \f[CR]number\f[R] indicating the total duration in milliseconds of all
iterations of the effect.
This is equal to \f[CR]duration\f[R] multiplied by \f[CR]iterations\f[R]
(or zero if that product would be \f[CR]NaN\f[R]).
.TP
\f[B]localTime\f[R]
A \f[CR]number\f[R] or \f[CR]null\f[R].
.RS
.PP
Indicates the length of time in milliseconds that the effect has run.
This is equal to the \f[CR]currentTime\f[R] of the associated animation,
or \f[CR]null\f[R] if the effect is not associated with an animation.
.RE
.TP
\f[B]progress\f[R]
\f[CR]null\f[R] or a \f[CR]number\f[R] at least \f[CR]0\f[R] and less
than \f[CR]1\f[R].
.RS
.PP
Indicates the effect\[cq]s progress through its current iteration.
At the start of the \f[CR]activeDuration\f[R], this equals the
fractional part of \f[CR]iterationStart\f[R].
.PP
Returns \f[CR]null\f[R] if the effect isn\[cq]t mid\-iteration, for
example because the effect is in the \f[CR]delay\f[R] or
\f[CR]endDelay\f[R] periods, the effect is finished, or
\f[CR]localTime\f[R] is \f[CR]null\f[R].
.RE
.TP
\f[B]currentIteration\f[R]
\f[CR]null\f[R] or an integer \f[CR]number\f[R].
.RS
.PP
Indicates the index of the current iteration.
At the start of the \f[CR]activeDuration\f[R], this equals the integer
part of \f[CR]iterationStart\f[R].
.PP
Returns \f[CR]null\f[R] whenever \f[CR]progress\f[R] is \f[CR]null\f[R].
