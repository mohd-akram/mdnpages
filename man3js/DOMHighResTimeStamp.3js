.SH NAME
DOMHighResTimeStamp \- DOMHighResTimeStamp
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]DOMHighResTimeStamp\f[B]\f[R] type is a \f[CR]double\f[R]
and is used to store a time value in milliseconds.
.PP
This type can be used to describe a discrete point in time or a time
interval (the difference in time between two discrete points in time).
The starting time can be either a specific time determined by the script
for a site or app, or the time origin.
.PP
The time, given in milliseconds, should be accurate to 5 µs
(microseconds), with the fractional part of the number indicating
fractions of a millisecond.
However, if the browser is unable to provide a time value accurate to 5
µs (due, for example, to hardware or software constraints), the browser
can represent the value as a time in milliseconds accurate to a
millisecond.
Also note the section below on reduced time precision controlled by
browser preferences to avoid timing attacks and fingerprinting.
.PP
Further, if the device or operating system the user agent is running on
doesn\[cq]t have a clock accurate to the microsecond level, they may
only be accurate to the millisecond.
.SH SECURITY REQUIREMENTS
To offer protection against timing attacks and fingerprinting,
\f[CR]DOMHighResTimeStamp\f[R] types are coarsened based on site
isolation status.
.IP \[bu] 2
Resolution in isolated contexts: 5 microseconds
.IP \[bu] 2
Resolution in non\-isolated contexts: 100 microseconds
.PP
Cross\-origin isolate your site using the
\f[CR]Cross\-Origin\-Opener\-Policy\f[R] and
\f[CR]Cross\-Origin\-Embedder\-Policy\f[R] headers:
.IP
.EX
Cross\-Origin\-Opener\-Policy: same\-origin
Cross\-Origin\-Embedder\-Policy: require\-corp
.EE
.PP
These headers ensure a top\-level document does not share a browsing
context group with cross\-origin documents.
COOP process\-isolates your document and potential attackers can\[cq]t
access to your global object if they were opening it in a popup,
preventing a set of cross\-origin attacks dubbed \c
