.SH NAME
AudioTrack.language \- AudioTrack: language property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The read\-only \f[B]\f[CB]AudioTrack\f[B]\f[R] property
\f[B]\f[CB]language\f[B]\f[R] returns a string identifying the language
used in the audio track.
.PP
For tracks that include multiple languages (such as a movie in English
in which a few lines are spoken in other languages), this should be the
video\(cqs primary language.
.SH VALUE
A string specifying the BCP 47 (RFC 5646) format language tag of the
primary language used in the audio track, or an empty string
(\f[CR]\(dq\(dq\f[R]) if the language is not specified or known, or if
the track doesn\(cqt contain speech.
.PP
For example, if the primary language used in the track is United States
English, this value would be \f[CR]\(dqen\-US\(dq\f[R].
For Brazilian Portuguese, the value would be \f[CR]\(dqpt\-BR\(dq\f[R].
.SH EXAMPLES
This example locates all of a media element\(cqs primary language and
translated audio tracks and returns a list of objects containing each of
those tracks\(cq \f[CR]id\f[R], \f[CR]kind\f[R], and
\f[CR]language\f[R].
.PP
This could then be used to build a user interface for selecting the
language the user would like to listen to while watching a movie, for
example.
