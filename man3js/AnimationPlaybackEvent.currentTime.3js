.SH NAME
AnimationPlaybackEvent.currentTime \- AnimationPlaybackEvent:
currentTime property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]currentTime\f[B]\f[R] read\-only property of the
\f[CR]AnimationPlaybackEvent\f[R] interface represents the current time
of the animation that generated the event at the moment the event is
queued.
This will be unresolved if the animation was \f[CR]idle\f[R] at the time
the event was generated.
.SH VALUE
A number representing the current time in milliseconds, or
\f[CR]null\f[R].
.SH REDUCED TIME PRECISION
To offer protection against timing attacks and fingerprinting, the
precision of \f[CR]playbackEvent.currentTime\f[R] might get rounded
depending on browser settings.
In Firefox, the \f[CR]privacy.reduceTimerPrecision\f[R] preference is
enabled by default and defaults to 2ms.
You can also enable \f[CR]privacy.resistFingerprinting\f[R], in which
case the precision will be 100ms or the value of
\f[CR]privacy.resistFingerprinting.reduceTimerPrecision.microseconds\f[R],
whichever is larger.
.PP
For example, with reduced time precision, the result of
\f[CR]playbackEvent.currentTime\f[R] will always be a multiple of 0.002,
or a multiple of 0.1 (or
\f[CR]privacy.resistFingerprinting.reduceTimerPrecision.microseconds\f[R])
with \f[CR]privacy.resistFingerprinting\f[R] enabled.
