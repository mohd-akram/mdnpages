Symbol \- Symbol
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f[B]\f[CB]Symbol\f[B]\f[R] is a built\-in object whose constructor
returns a \f[CR]symbol\f[R] primitive \[em] also called a \f[B]Symbol
value\f[R] or just a \f[B]Symbol\f[R] \[em] that\[cq]s guaranteed to be
unique.
Symbols are often used to add unique property keys to an object that
won\[cq]t collide with keys any other code might add to the object, and
which are hidden from any mechanisms other code will typically use to
access the object.
That enables a form of weak encapsulation, or a weak form of \c
.UR https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_hiding
information hiding
.UE \c
\&.
.PP
Every \f[CR]Symbol()\f[R] call is guaranteed to return a unique Symbol.
Every \f[CR]Symbol.for(\[dq]key\[dq])\f[R] call will always return the
same Symbol for a given value of \f[CR]\[dq]key\[dq]\f[R].
When \f[CR]Symbol.for(\[dq]key\[dq])\f[R] is called, if a Symbol with
the given key can be found in the global Symbol registry, that Symbol is
returned.
Otherwise, a new Symbol is created, added to the global Symbol registry
under the given key, and returned.
.SH DESCRIPTION
To create a new primitive Symbol, you write \f[CR]Symbol()\f[R] with an
optional string as its description:
.IP
.EX
\f[B]const\f[R] sym1 = Symbol();
\f[B]const\f[R] sym2 = Symbol(\[dq]foo\[dq]);
\f[B]const\f[R] sym3 = Symbol(\[dq]foo\[dq]);
.EE
.PP
The above code creates three new Symbols.
Note that \f[CR]Symbol(\[dq]foo\[dq])\f[R] does not coerce the string
\f[CR]\[dq]foo\[dq]\f[R] into a Symbol.
It creates a new Symbol each time:
.IP
.EX
Symbol(\[dq]foo\[dq]) === Symbol(\[dq]foo\[dq]); \f[I]// false\f[R]
.EE
.PP
The following syntax with the \f[CR]new\f[R] operator will throw a
\f[CR]TypeError\f[R]:
.PP
\f[B]Bad\f[R]
.IP
.EX
\f[B]const\f[R] sym = \f[B]new\f[R] Symbol(); \f[I]// TypeError\f[R]
.EE
.PP
This prevents authors from creating an explicit \f[CR]Symbol\f[R]
wrapper object instead of a new Symbol value and might be surprising as
creating explicit wrapper objects around primitive data types is
generally possible (for example, \f[CR]new Boolean\f[R],
\f[CR]new String\f[R] and \f[CR]new Number\f[R]).
.PP
If you really want to create a \f[CR]Symbol\f[R] wrapper object, you can
use the \f[CR]Object()\f[R] function:
.IP
.EX
\f[B]const\f[R] sym = Symbol(\[dq]foo\[dq]);
\f[B]typeof\f[R] sym; \f[I]// \[dq]symbol\[dq]\f[R]
\f[B]const\f[R] symObj = Object(sym);
\f[B]typeof\f[R] symObj; \f[I]// \[dq]object\[dq]\f[R]
.EE
.PP
Because symbols are the only primitive data type that has reference
identity (that is, you cannot create the same symbol twice), they behave
like objects in some way.
For example, they are garbage collectable and can therefore be stored in
\f[CR]WeakMap\f[R], \f[CR]WeakSet\f[R], \f[CR]WeakRef\f[R], and
\f[CR]FinalizationRegistry\f[R] objects.
.SS Shared Symbols in the global Symbol registry
The above syntax using the \f[CR]Symbol()\f[R] function will create a
Symbol whose value remains unique throughout the lifetime of the
program.
To create Symbols available across files and even across realms (each of
which has its own global scope), use the methods \f[CR]Symbol.for()\f[R]
and \f[CR]Symbol.keyFor()\f[R] to set and retrieve Symbols from the
global Symbol registry.
.PP
Note that the \[lq]global Symbol registry\[rq] is only a fictitious
concept and may not correspond to any internal data structure in the
JavaScript engine \[em] and even if such a registry exists, its content
is not available to the JavaScript code, except through the
\f[CR]for()\f[R] and \f[CR]keyFor()\f[R] methods.
.PP
The method \f[CR]Symbol.for(tokenString)\f[R] takes a string key and
returns a symbol value from the registry, while
\f[CR]Symbol.keyFor(symbolValue)\f[R] takes a symbol value and returns
the string key corresponding to it.
Each is the other\[cq]s inverse, so the following is \f[CR]true\f[R]:
.IP
.EX
Symbol.keyFor(Symbol.for(\[dq]tokenString\[dq])) === \[dq]tokenString\[dq]; \f[I]// true\f[R]
.EE
.PP
Because registered symbols can be arbitrarily created anywhere, they
behave almost exactly like the strings they wrap.
Therefore, they are not guaranteed to be unique and are not garbage
collectable.
Therefore, registered symbols are disallowed in \f[CR]WeakMap\f[R],
\f[CR]WeakSet\f[R], \f[CR]WeakRef\f[R], and
\f[CR]FinalizationRegistry\f[R] objects.
.SS Well\-known Symbols
All static properties of the \f[CR]Symbol\f[R] constructor are Symbols
themselves, whose values are constant across realms.
They are known as \f[I]well\-known Symbols\f[R], and their purpose is to
serve as \[lq]protocols\[rq] for certain built\-in JavaScript
operations, allowing users to customize the language\[cq]s behavior.
For example, if a constructor function has a method with
\f[CR]Symbol.hasInstance\f[R] as its name, this method will encode its
behavior with the \f[CR]instanceof\f[R] operator.
.PP
Prior to well\-known Symbols, JavaScript used normal properties to
implement certain built\-in operations.
For example, the \f[CR]JSON.stringify\f[R] function will attempt to call
each object\[cq]s \f[CR]toJSON()\f[R] method, and the \f[CR]String\f[R]
function will call the object\[cq]s \f[CR]toString()\f[R] and
\f[CR]valueOf()\f[R] methods.
However, as more operations are added to the language, designating each
operation a \[lq]magic property\[rq] can break backward compatibility
and make the language\[cq]s behavior harder to reason with.
Well\-known Symbols allow the customizations to be \[lq]invisible\[rq]
from normal code, which typically only read string properties.
.RS
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R] The spec used to use the notation
\f[CR]\[at]\[at]<symbol\-name>\f[R] to denote well\-known symbols.
For example, \f[CR]Symbol.hasInstance\f[R] was written as
\f[CR]\[at]\[at]hasInstance\f[R], and the
\f[CR]Array.prototype[Symbol.iterator]()\f[R] method would be called
\f[CR]Array.prototype[\[at]\[at]iterator]()\f[R].
This notation is no longer used in the spec, but you may still see it in
older documentation or discussions.
.RE
.PP
Well\-known symbols do not have the concept of garbage collectability,
because they come in a fixed set and are unique throughout the lifetime
of the program, similar to intrinsic objects such as
\f[CR]Array.prototype\f[R], so they are also allowed in
\f[CR]WeakMap\f[R], \f[CR]WeakSet\f[R], \f[CR]WeakRef\f[R], and
\f[CR]FinalizationRegistry\f[R] objects.
.SS Finding Symbol properties on objects
The method \f[CR]Object.getOwnPropertySymbols()\f[R] returns an array of
Symbols and lets you find Symbol properties on a given object.
Note that every object is initialized with no own Symbol properties, so
that this array will be empty unless you\[cq]ve set Symbol properties on
the object.
.SH CONSTRUCTOR
.TP
\f[B]Symbol()\f[R]
Returns primitive values of type Symbol.
Throws an error when called with \f[CR]new\f[R].
.SH STATIC PROPERTIES
The static properties are all well\-known Symbols.
In these Symbols\[cq] descriptions, we will use language like
\[lq]\f[CR]Symbol.hasInstance\f[R] is a method determining\&...\[rq],
but bear in mind that this is referring to the semantic of an
object\[cq]s method having this Symbol as the method name (because
well\-known Symbols act as \[lq]protocols\[rq]), not describing the
value of the Symbol itself.
.TP
\f[B]Symbol.asyncIterator\f[R]
A method that returns the default AsyncIterator for an object.
Used by \f[CR]for await...of\f[R].

from the \f[CR]with\f[R] environment bindings of the associated object.
.SH STATIC METHODS
.TP
\f[B]Symbol.for()\f[R]
Searches for existing registered Symbols in the global Symbol registry
with the given \f[CR]key\f[R] and returns it if found.
Otherwise a new Symbol gets created and registered with \f[CR]key\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]Symbol.keyFor()\f[R]
Retrieves a shared Symbol key from the global Symbol registry for the
given Symbol.
.SH INSTANCE PROPERTIES
These properties are defined on \f[CR]Symbol.prototype\f[R] and shared
by all \f[CR]Symbol\f[R] instances.
.TP
\f[B]Symbol.prototype.constructor\f[R]

This property is used in \f[CR]Object.prototype.toString()\f[R].
However, because \f[CR]Symbol\f[R] also has its own
\f[CR]toString()\f[R] method, this property is not used unless you call

.TP
\f[B]Symbol.prototype[Symbol.toPrimitive]()\f[R]
Returns the Symbol.
.SH EXAMPLES
.SS Using the typeof operator with Symbols
The \f[CR]typeof\f[R] operator can help you to identify Symbols.
.IP
.EX
\f[B]typeof\f[R] Symbol() === \[dq]symbol\[dq];
\f[B]typeof\f[R] Symbol(\[dq]foo\[dq]) === \[dq]symbol\[dq];
\f[B]typeof\f[R] Symbol.iterator === \[dq]symbol\[dq];
.EE
.SS Symbol type conversions
Some things to note when working with type conversion of Symbols.
.IP \[bu] 2
When trying to convert a Symbol to a number, a \f[CR]TypeError\f[R] will
be thrown (e.g.\ \f[CR]+sym\f[R] or \f[CR]sym | 0\f[R]).
.IP \[bu] 2
When using loose equality, \f[CR]Object(sym) == sym\f[R] returns
\f[CR]true\f[R].
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]Symbol(\[dq]foo\[dq]) + \[dq]bar\[dq]\f[R] throws a
\f[CR]TypeError\f[R] (can\[cq]t convert Symbol to string).
This prevents you from silently creating a new string property name from
a Symbol, for example.
.IP \[bu] 2
The \[lq]safer\[rq] \f[CR]String(sym)\f[R] conversion works like a call
to \f[CR]Symbol.prototype.toString()\f[R] with Symbols, but note that
\f[CR]new String(sym)\f[R] will throw.
.SS Symbols and for\&...in iteration
Symbols are not enumerable in \f[CR]for...in\f[R] iterations.
In addition, \f[CR]Object.getOwnPropertyNames()\f[R] will not return
Symbol object properties, however, you can use
\f[CR]Object.getOwnPropertySymbols()\f[R] to get these.
.IP
.EX
\f[B]const\f[R] obj = {};

obj[Symbol(\[dq]a\[dq])] = \[dq]a\[dq];
obj[Symbol.for(\[dq]b\[dq])] = \[dq]b\[dq];
obj[\[dq]c\[dq]] = \[dq]c\[dq];
obj.d = \[dq]d\[dq];

\f[B]for\f[R] (\f[B]const\f[R] i \f[B]in\f[R] obj) {
  console.log(i);
}
\f[I]// \[dq]c\[dq] \[dq]d\[dq]\f[R]
.EE
.SS Symbols and JSON.stringify()
Symbol\-keyed properties will be completely ignored when using
\f[CR]JSON.stringify()\f[R]:
.IP
.EX
JSON.stringify({ [Symbol(\[dq]foo\[dq])]: \[dq]foo\[dq] });
\f[I]// \[aq]{}\[aq]\f[R]
.EE
.PP
For more details, see \f[CR]JSON.stringify()\f[R].
.SS Symbol wrapper objects as property keys
When a Symbol wrapper object is used as a property key, this object will
be coerced to its wrapped Symbol:
.IP
.EX
\f[B]const\f[R] sym = Symbol(\[dq]foo\[dq]);
\f[B]const\f[R] obj = { [sym]: 1 };
obj[sym]; \f[I]// 1\f[R]
obj[Object(sym)]; \f[I]// still 1\f[R]
