.SH NAME
RTCInboundRtpStreamStats.pliCount \- RTCInboundRtpStreamStats: pliCount
property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]pliCount\f[B]\f[R] property of the
\f[CR]RTCInboundRtpStreamStats\f[R] dictionary states the number of
times the \f[CR]RTCRtpReceiver\f[R] described by these statistics sent a
\f[B]Picture Loss Indication\f[R] (\f[B]PLI\f[R]) packet to the sender.
.PP
A PLI packet indicates that some amount of encoded video data has been
lost for one or more frames.
.SH VALUE
An integer value indicating the number of times a PLI packet was sent by
the \f[CR]RTCRtpReceiver\f[R] to the sender.
These are sent by the receiver\[cq]s decoder to notify the encoder (the
sender) that an undefined amount of coded video data, which may span
frame boundaries, has been lost.
This information is only available for video streams.
.PP
This may trigger the sender to send a full frame in order to allow the
receiver to re\-synchronize, since lost data may be an irrecoverable
situation for decoding media.
However, the primary purpose of this message is to allow the sender to
consider techniques to mitigate network performance issues.
This is often achieved by methods such as increasing the compression,
lowering resolution, or finding other ways to reduce the bit rate of the
stream.
