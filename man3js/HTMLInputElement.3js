.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]HTMLInputElement\f[B]\f[R] interface provides special
properties and methods for manipulating the options, layout, and
presentation of \f[CR]<input>\f[R] elements.
.SH INSTANCE PROPERTIES
\f[I]Also inherits properties from its parent interface,
\f[CI]HTMLElement\f[I].\f[R]

Some properties only apply to input element types that support the
corresponding attributes.

\f[B]dirName\f[R]
A string that represents the directionality of the element.
.TP
\f[B]incremental\f[R] \f[I](non\-standard)\f[R]
A boolean that represents the search event fire mode, if

The property may be \f[CR]null\f[R] if no HTML element is found in the
same tree.
.TP

.TP
\f[B]checkValidity()\f[R]
Returns a boolean value that is \f[CR]false\f[R] if the element is a
candidate for constraint validation, and it does not satisfy its
constraints.
In this case, it also fires an \f[CR]invalid\f[R] event at the element.
It returns \f[CR]true\f[R] if the element is not a candidate for
constraint validation, or if it satisfies its constraints.
.TP
\f[B]reportValidity()\f[R]
Runs the \f[CR]checkValidity()\f[R] method, and if it returns false (for
an invalid input or no pattern attribute provided), then it reports to
the user that the input is invalid in the same manner as if you
submitted a form.
.TP
\f[B]select()\f[R]
Selects all the text in the input element, and focuses it so the user
can subsequently replace all of its content.
.TP
\f[B]setCustomValidity()\f[R]

If this message is not the empty string, then the element is suffering
from a custom validity error, and does not validate.
.TP
\f[B]setRangeText()\f[R]
Replaces a range of text in the input element with new text.
.TP
\f[B]setSelectionRange()\f[R]

Decrements the \f[CR]value\f[R] by (\f[CR]step\f[R] * n), where n
defaults to 1 if not specified.
.TP
\f[B]stepUp()\f[R]
Increments the \f[CR]value\f[R] by (\f[CR]step\f[R] * n), where n
defaults to 1 if not specified.
.SH EVENTS
\f[I]Also inherits events from its parent interface,
\f[CI]HTMLElement\f[I].\f[R]
.PP
Listen to these events using \f[CR]addEventListener()\f[R] or by
assigning an event listener to the \f[CR]oneventname\f[R] property of
this interface:
.TP

Fired when an element does not satisfy its constraints during constraint
validation.
.TP
\f[B]search\f[R] event \f[I](non\-standard)\f[R]
Fired when a search is initiated on an \f[CR]<input>\f[R] of
\f[CR]type=\[dq]search\[dq]\f[R].

Fired when some text has been selected.
.TP
\f[B]selectionchange\f[R] event \f[I](experimental)\f[R]
