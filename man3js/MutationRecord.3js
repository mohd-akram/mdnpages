MutationRecord \- MutationRecord
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]MutationRecord\f[B]\f[R] is a read\-only interface that
represents an individual DOM mutation observed by a
\f[CR]MutationObserver\f[R].
It is the object inside the array passed to the callback of a
\f[CR]MutationObserver\f[R].
.SH INSTANCE PROPERTIES
.TP
\f[B]MutationRecord.addedNodes\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
The nodes added by a mutation.
Will be an empty \f[CR]NodeList\f[R] if no nodes were added.
.TP
\f[B]MutationRecord.attributeName\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
The name of the changed attribute as a string, or \f[CR]null\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]MutationRecord.attributeNamespace\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
The namespace of the changed attribute as a string, or \f[CR]null\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]MutationRecord.nextSibling\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
The next sibling of the added or removed nodes, or \f[CR]null\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]MutationRecord.oldValue\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
The value depends on the \f[CR]MutationRecord.type\f[R]:
.RS
.IP \(bu 2
For \f[CR]attributes\f[R], it is the value of the changed attribute
before the change.
.IP \(bu 2
For \f[CR]characterData\f[R], it is the data of the changed node before
the change.
.IP \(bu 2
For \f[CR]childList\f[R], it is \f[CR]null\f[R].
.RE
.TP
\f[B]MutationRecord.previousSibling\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
The previous sibling of the added or removed nodes, or \f[CR]null\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]MutationRecord.removedNodes\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
The nodes removed by a mutation.
Will be an empty \f[CR]NodeList\f[R] if no nodes were removed.
.TP
\f[B]MutationRecord.target\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
The node the mutation affected, depending on the
\f[CR]MutationRecord.type\f[R].
.RS
.IP \(bu 2
For \f[CR]attributes\f[R], it is the element whose attribute changed.
.IP \(bu 2
For \f[CR]characterData\f[R], it is the \f[CR]CharacterData\f[R] node.
.IP \(bu 2
For \f[CR]childList\f[R], it is the node whose children changed.
.RE
.TP
\f[B]MutationRecord.type\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
A string representing the type of mutation: \f[CR]attributes\f[R] if the
mutation was an attribute mutation, \f[CR]characterData\f[R] if it was a
mutation to a \f[CR]CharacterData\f[R] node, and \f[CR]childList\f[R] if
it was a mutation to the tree of nodes.
