HTMLTrackElement \- HTMLTrackElement
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]HTMLTrackElement\f[B]\f[R] interface represents an HTML
\f[CR]<track>\f[R] element within the DOM.
This element can be used as a child of either \f[CR]<audio>\f[R] or
\f[CR]<video>\f[R] to specify a text track containing information such
as closed captions or subtitles.
.SH INSTANCE PROPERTIES

\f[B]HTMLTrackElement.kind\f[R]
A string that reflects the \f[CR]kind\f[R] HTML attribute, indicating
how the text track is meant to be used.
Possible values are: \f[CR]subtitles\f[R], \f[CR]captions\f[R],
\f[CR]descriptions\f[R], \f[CR]chapters\f[R], or \f[CR]metadata\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]HTMLTrackElement.src\f[R]
A string that reflects the \f[CR]src\f[R] HTML attribute, indicating the
address of the text track data.
.TP
\f[B]HTMLTrackElement.srclang\f[R]
A string that reflects the \f[CR]srclang\f[R] HTML attribute, indicating
the language of the text track data.
.TP
\f[B]HTMLTrackElement.label\f[R]
A string that reflects the \f[CR]label\f[R] HTML attribute, indicating a

.TP
\f[B]HTMLTrackElement.default\f[R]
A boolean value reflecting the \f[CR]default\f[R] attribute, indicating
that the track is to be enabled if the user\(cqs preferences do not
indicate that another track would be more appropriate.
.TP
\f[B]HTMLTrackElement.readyState\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
Returns an \f[CR]unsigned short\f[R] that show the readiness state of
the track:

\f[B]HTMLTrackElement.track\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
Returns \f[CR]TextTrack\f[R] is the track element\(cqs text track data.
.SH INSTANCE METHODS
\f[I]No specific method; inherits methods from its parent,
\f[CI]HTMLElement\f[I].\f[R]
.SH EVENTS
\f[I]Inherits events from its parent, \f[CI]HTMLElement\f[I].\f[R]
.PP
Listen to these events using \f[CR]addEventListener()\f[R] or by
assigning an event listener to the \f[CR]oneventname\f[R] property of
this interface:
.TP
\f[B]cuechange\f[R]
Sent when the underlying \f[CR]TextTrack\f[R] has changed the
currently\-presented cues.
This event is always sent to the \f[CR]TextTrack\f[R] but is
\f[I]also\f[R] sent to the \f[CR]HTMLTrackElement\f[R] if one is
associated with the track.
You may also use the \f[CR]oncuechange\f[R] event handler to establish a
handler for this event.
.SH USAGE NOTES
.SS Loading of the track\(cqs text resource
The WebVTT or TTML data describing the actual cues for the text track
isn\(cqt loaded if the track\(cqs \f[CR]mode\f[R] is initially in the
\f[CR]disabled\f[R] state.
If you need to be able to perform any processing on the track after the
\f[CR]<track>\f[R] is set up, you should instead ensure that the
track\(cqs \f[CR]mode\f[R] is either \f[CR]hidden\f[R] (if you don\(cqt
want it to start out being presented to the user) or \f[CR]showing\f[R]
(to initially display the track).
You can then change the mode as desired later.
