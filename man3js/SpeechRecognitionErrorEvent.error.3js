.SH NAME
SpeechRecognitionErrorEvent.error \- SpeechRecognitionErrorEvent: error
property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]error\f[B]\f[R] read\-only property of the
\f[CR]SpeechRecognitionErrorEvent\f[R] interface returns the type of
error raised.
.SH VALUE
A string naming the type of error.
The possible error types are:
.TP
\f[B]no\-speech\f[R]
No speech was detected.
.TP
\f[B]aborted\f[R]
Speech input was aborted in some manner, perhaps by some
user\-agent\-specific behavior like a button the user can press to
cancel speech input.
.TP
\f[B]audio\-capture\f[R]
Audio capture failed.
.TP
\f[B]network\f[R]
Network communication required for completing the recognition failed.
.TP
\f[B]not\-allowed\f[R]
The user agent disallowed any speech input from occurring for reasons of
security, privacy or user preference.
.TP
\f[B]service\-not\-allowed\f[R]
The user agent disallowed the requested speech recognition service,
either because the user agent doesn\[cq]t support it or because of
reasons of security, privacy or user preference.
In this case it would allow another more suitable speech recognition
service to be used instead.
.TP
\f[B]bad\-grammar\f[R]
There was an error in the speech recognition grammar or semantic tags,
or the chosen grammar format or semantic tag format was unsupported.
.TP
\f[B]language\-not\-supported\f[R]
The user agent does not support the language specified in the value of
\f[CR]lang\f[R] attribute of the \f[CR]SpeechRecognition\f[R] object.
The set of supported languages is browser\-dependent, and from frontend
code there is no way to programmatically determine what languages a
user\[cq]s browser supports for speech recognition.

.EX
\f[B]const\f[R] recognition = \f[B]new\f[R] SpeechRecognition();
