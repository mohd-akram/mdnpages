.SH NAME
Set.isDisjointFrom - Set.prototype.isDisjointFrom()
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]isDisjointFrom()\f[B]\f[R] method of \f[CR]Set\f[R]
instances takes a set and returns a boolean indicating if this set has
no elements in common with the given set.
.SH SYNTAX
.IP
.EX
isDisjointFrom(other)
.EE
.SS Parameters
.TP
\f[B]other\f[R]
A \f[CR]Set\f[R] object, or set-like object.
.SS Return value
\f[CR]true\f[R] if this set has no elements in common with the
\f[CR]other\f[R] set, and \f[CR]false\f[R] otherwise.
.SH DESCRIPTION
Two sets are \f[I]disjoint\f[R] if they have no elements in common.
In mathematical notation:
.PP
A\ is disjoint from\ B⇔A∩B=∅AB AB =
.PP
And using Venn diagram:

A and B are disjoint because the circles have no region of overlap.]

.PP
\f[CR]isDisjointFrom()\f[R] accepts set-like objects as the
\f[CR]other\f[R] parameter.
It requires \f[CR]this\f[R] to be an actual \f[CR]Set\f[R] instance,
because it directly retrieves the underlying data stored in
\f[CR]this\f[R] without invoking any user code.
Then, its behavior depends on the sizes of \f[CR]this\f[R] and
\f[CR]other\f[R]:
.IP \[bu] 2
If there are more elements in \f[CR]this\f[R] than
\f[CR]other.size\f[R], then it iterates over \f[CR]other\f[R] by calling
its \f[CR]keys()\f[R] method, and if any element in \f[CR]other\f[R] is
present in \f[CR]this\f[R], it returns \f[CR]false\f[R] (and closes the
\f[CR]keys()\f[R] iterator by calling its \f[CR]return()\f[R] method).
Otherwise, it returns \f[CR]true\f[R].
.IP \[bu] 2
Otherwise, it iterates over the elements in \f[CR]this\f[R], and returns
\f[CR]false\f[R] if any element \f[CR]e\f[R] in \f[CR]this\f[R] causes
\f[CR]other.has(e)\f[R] to return a truthy value.
Otherwise, it returns \f[CR]true\f[R].
.PP
Because of this implementation, the efficiency of
\f[CR]isDisjointFrom()\f[R] mostly depends on the size of the smaller
set between \f[CR]this\f[R] and \f[CR]other\f[R] (assuming sets can be
accessed in sublinear time).
.SH EXAMPLES
.SS Using isDisjointFrom()
The set of perfect squares (<20) is disjoint from the set of prime
numbers (<20), because a perfect square is by definition decomposable
into the product of two integers, while 1 is also not considered a prime
number:
.IP
.EX
const primes = new Set([2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19]);
const squares = new Set([1, 4, 9, 16]);
console.log(primes.isDisjointFrom(squares)); // true
.EE
.PP
The set of perfect squares (<20) is not disjoint from the set of
composite numbers (<20), because all non-1 perfect squares are by
definition composite numbers:
.IP
.EX
const composites = new Set([4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18]);
const squares = new Set([1, 4, 9, 16]);
console.log(composites.isDisjointFrom(squares)); // false
