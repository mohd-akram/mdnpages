.SH NAME
Notification.close \- Notification: close() method
.SH SYNOPSIS
This feature is available in Web Workers.\f[B]Secure context\f[R]: This
feature is available only in secure contexts (HTTPS).
.PP
The \f[CR]close()\f[R] method of the \f[CR]Notification\f[R] interface
is used to close/remove a previously displayed notification.
.RS
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R] This API shouldn\[cq]t be used just to have the
notification removed from the screen after a fixed delay since this
method will also remove the notification from any notification tray,
preventing users from interacting with it after it was initially shown.
A valid use for this API would be to remove a notification that is no
longer relevant (e.g.\ the user already read the notification on the
webpage in the case of a messaging app or the following song is already
playing in a music app).

.SH EXAMPLES
In the following snippet, we have a simple function that when called
creates an \f[CR]options\f[R] object and then a new notification.
At the end of the function, it also calls \f[CR]close()\f[R] inside a
\f[CR]addEventListener()\f[R] function to remove the notification when
the relevant content has been read on the webpage.

function spawnNotification(theBody, theIcon, theTitle) {
  const options = {
    body: theBody,
    icon: theIcon,

  const n = new Notification(theTitle, options);
  document.addEventListener(\[dq]visibilitychange\[dq], () => {
    if (document.visibilityState === \[dq]visible\[dq]) {
      // The tab has become visible so clear the now\-stale Notification.
      n.close();
