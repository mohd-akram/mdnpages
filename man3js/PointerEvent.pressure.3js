.SH NAME
PointerEvent.pressure \- PointerEvent: pressure property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]pressure\f[B]\f[R] read\-only property of the
\f[CR]PointerEvent\f[R] interface indicates the normalized pressure of
the pointer input.
.SH VALUE
The normalized pressure of the pointer input in the range of
\f[CR]0\f[R] to \f[CR]1\f[R], inclusive, where \f[CR]0\f[R] and
\f[CR]1\f[R] represent the minimum and maximum pressure the hardware is
capable of detecting, respectively.
For hardware that does not support pressure, such as a mouse, the value
is \f[CR]0.5\f[R] when the pointer is active buttons state and
\f[CR]0\f[R] otherwise.
.SH EXAMPLES
In this snippet, when a \f[CR]pointerdown\f[R] event is fired, different
functions are called depending on the value of the event\[cq]s
\f[CR]pressure\f[R] property.
