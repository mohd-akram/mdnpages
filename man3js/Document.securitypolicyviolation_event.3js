.SH NAME
Document.securitypolicyviolation_event \- Document:
securitypolicyviolation event
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]securitypolicyviolation\f[B]\f[R] event is fired when a
Content Security Policy is violated.
.PP
The event is fired on the document when there is a violation of the
document CSP policy (and may also bubble from elements in the document).
.PP
This event bubbles to the \f[CR]Window\f[R] object, and is composed.
.RS
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R] You should generally add the handler for this event to a
top level object (i.e., \f[CR]Window\f[R] or \f[CR]Document\f[R]).
While HTML elements can technically be the target of the
\f[CR]securitypolicyviolation\f[R] event, in reality this event does not
fire on them\(emfor example, a blocked \f[CR]<img>\f[R] source directly
triggers this event on \f[CR]document\f[R] as the target, instead of
bubbling from the \f[CR]<img>\f[R] element.
.RE
.SH SYNTAX
Use the event name in methods like \f[CR]addEventListener()\f[R], or set
an event handler property.

document.onsecuritypolicyviolation = (e) \f[B]=>\f[R] {
  \f[I]// Handle SecurityPolicyViolationEvent e here\f[R]
