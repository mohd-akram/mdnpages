.SH NAME
URL.createObjectURL_static \- URL: createObjectURL() static method
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f[B]Note:\f[R] This feature is available in Web Workers, except for
Service Workers.
.PP
The \f[B]\f[CB]createObjectURL()\f[B]\f[R] static method of the
\f[CR]URL\f[R] interface creates a string containing a URL representing
the object given in the parameter.
.PP
The URL lifetime is tied to the \f[CR]document\f[R] in the window on
which it was created.
The new object URL represents the specified \f[CR]File\f[R] object or
\f[CR]Blob\f[R] object.
.PP
To release an object URL, call \f[CR]revokeObjectURL()\f[R].
.RS
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R] This feature is \f[I]not\f[R] available in Service
Workers due to its potential to create memory leaks.

.SS Parameters
.TP
\f[B]object\f[R]
A \f[CR]File\f[R], \f[CR]Blob\f[R], or \f[CR]MediaSource\f[R] object to
create an object URL for.
.SS Return value
A string containing an object URL that can be used to reference the
contents of the specified source \f[CR]object\f[R].
.SH EXAMPLES
See Using object URLs to display images.
.SH USAGE NOTES
.SS Memory management
Each time you call \f[CR]createObjectURL()\f[R], a new object URL is
created, even if you\[cq]ve already created one for the same object.
Each of these must be released by calling
\f[CR]URL.revokeObjectURL()\f[R] when you no longer need them.
.PP
Browsers will release object URLs automatically when the document is
unloaded; however, for optimal performance and memory usage, if there
are safe times when you can explicitly unload them, you should do so.
.SS Using object URLs for media streams
In older versions of the Media Source specification, attaching a stream
to a \f[CR]<video>\f[R] element required creating an object URL for the
\f[CR]MediaStream\f[R].
This is no longer necessary, and browsers are removing support for doing
this.
.RS
.PP
\f[B]Warning:\f[R] If you still have code that relies on
\f[CR]createObjectURL()\f[R] to attach streams to media elements, you
need to update your code to set \f[CR]srcObject\f[R] to the
\f[CR]MediaStream\f[R] directly.
