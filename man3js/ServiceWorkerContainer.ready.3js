.SH NAME
ServiceWorkerContainer.ready \- ServiceWorkerContainer: ready property
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f[B]Secure context:\f[R] This feature is available only in secure
contexts (HTTPS).
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R] This feature is available in Web Workers.
.PP
The \f[B]\f[CB]ready\f[B]\f[R] read\-only property of the
\f[CR]ServiceWorkerContainer\f[R] interface provides a way of delaying
code execution until a service worker is active.
It returns a \f[CR]Promise\f[R] that will never reject, and which waits
indefinitely until the \f[CR]ServiceWorkerRegistration\f[R] associated
with the current page has an \f[CR]active\f[R] worker.
Once that condition is met, it resolves with the
\f[CR]ServiceWorkerRegistration\f[R].
.SH VALUE
A \f[CR]Promise\f[R] that will never reject, and which may eventually
resolve with a \f[CR]ServiceWorkerRegistration\f[R].
.SH EXAMPLES
.IP
.EX
\f[B]if\f[R] (\[dq]serviceWorker\[dq] \f[B]in\f[R] navigator) {
  navigator.serviceWorker.ready.then((registration) \f[B]=>\f[R] {
    console.log(\[ga]A service worker is active: ${registration.active}\[ga]);

    \f[I]// At this point, you can call methods that require an active\f[R]
    \f[I]// service worker, like registration.pushManager.subscribe()\f[R]
  });
} \f[B]else\f[R] {
  console.error(\[dq]Service workers are not supported.\[dq]);
