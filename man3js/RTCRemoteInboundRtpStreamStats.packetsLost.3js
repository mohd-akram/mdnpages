.SH NAME
RTCRemoteInboundRtpStreamStats.packetsLost \-
RTCRemoteInboundRtpStreamStats: packetsLost property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]packetsLost\f[B]\f[R] property of the
\f[CR]RTCRemoteInboundRtpStreamStats\f[R] dictionary returns the total
number of RTP packets lost from the synchronization source (SSRC), as
reported by the remote endpoint, since the beginning of reception.
.SH VALUE
An integer value indicating the number of lost RTP packets.
.PP
This value can be negative.
It is determined by subtracting the number of packets received from the
number of packets that are expected.
The number of packets that are expected is calculated in a way that
assumes that all packets only need to be sent once (based on sequence
numbers), while the number of packets received also includes any packets
that had to be resent (and hence may be bigger).
For more information see the \[lq]cumulative number of packets lost\[rq]
section in RFC 3550, section 6.4.1).
