The key whose value you want returned.
.SS Return value
A string specifying the status value associated with the given key, or
\f[CR]undefined\f[R].
.PP
The following status values are allowed:
.TP
\f[B]usable\f[R]
The key is currently usable for decryption.
.TP
\f[B]expired\f[R]
The key is no longer usable for decryption because its expiration time
has passed.
.TP
\f[B]released\f[R]
The key has been released and is no longer available to the CDM.
However information about the key is available, such as a record of
license destruction.
.TP
\f[B]output\-restricted\f[R]
There are output restrictions associated with the key based on the
specified policy.
Media data decrypted with this key may be blocked from presentation.
The status indicates that the connection between the source and output
(for example, your computer and an external display), is not trusted.
This might indicate that there are HDCP version mismatches between the
source, intermediate devices, and output, or that intermediate
connecting devices such as HDMI cables or video splitters are damaged or
non\-compliant.
An application might opt to use a higher HDCP version, content that does
not require such a high version.
You should also check that intermediate devices and cables support HDCP,
are connected firmly, and are not damaged.
.TP
\f[B]output\-downscaled\f[R]
There are output restrictions associated with the key based on the
specified policy, however these restrictions might be relaxed if the
content is played at a lower quality.
If this value is returned an application might play the content at a
lower resolution, or it could choose to use a higher HDCP version, or
use other content that does not require such a high HDCP version.
.TP
\f[B]usable\-in\-future\f[R]
The key will become usable for decryption in future, once its start time
is reached.
.TP
\f[B]status\-pending\f[R]
The status of the key is not yet known and is being determined.
.TP
\f[B]internal\-error\f[R]
The key is not currently usable for decryption because of an error in
the CDM.
The application can\[cq]t do anything to handle this case.
