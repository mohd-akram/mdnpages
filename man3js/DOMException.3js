.SH NAME
DOMException \- DOMException
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f[B]Note:\f[R] This feature is available in Web Workers.
.PP
The \f[B]\f[CB]DOMException\f[B]\f[R] interface represents an abnormal
event (called an \f[B]exception\f[R]) that occurs as a result of calling
a method or accessing a property of a web API.
This is how error conditions are described in web APIs.
.PP
Each exception has a \f[B]name\f[R], which is a short
\[lq]PascalCase\[rq]\-style string identifying the error or abnormal
condition.
.PP
\f[CR]DOMException\f[R] is a Serializable object, so it can be cloned
with \f[CR]structuredClone()\f[R] or copied between Workers using
\f[CR]postMessage()\f[R].
.SH CONSTRUCTOR
.TP
\f[B]DOMException()\f[R]
Returns a \f[CR]DOMException\f[R] object with a specified message and
name.
.SH INSTANCE PROPERTIES
.TP
\f[B]DOMException.code\f[R] \f[I](deprecated)\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
Returns one of the legacy error code constants, or \f[CR]0\f[R] if none
match.
.TP
\f[B]DOMException.message\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
Returns a string representing a message or description associated with
the given error name.
.TP
\f[B]DOMException.name\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
Returns a string that contains one of the strings associated with an
error name.
.SH ERROR NAMES
Common error names are listed here.
Some APIs define their own sets of names, so this is not necessarily a
complete list.
.PP
Note that the following deprecated historical errors don\[cq]t have an
error name but instead have only a legacy constant code value and a
legacy constant name:
.IP \[bu] 2
Legacy code value: \f[CR]2\f[R], legacy constant name:
\f[CR]DOMSTRING_SIZE_ERR\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
Legacy code value: \f[CR]6\f[R], legacy constant name:
\f[CR]NO_DATA_ALLOWED_ERR\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
Legacy code value: \f[CR]16\f[R], legacy constant name:
\f[CR]VALIDATION_ERR\f[R]
.RS
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R] Because historically the errors were identified by a
numeric value that corresponded with a named variable defined to have
that value, some of the entries below indicate the legacy code value and
constant name that were used in the past.
