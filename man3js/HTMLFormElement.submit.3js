.SH NAME
HTMLFormElement.submit \- HTMLFormElement: submit() method
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]HTMLFormElement.submit()\f[B]\f[R] method submits a given
\f[CR]<form>\f[R].
.PP
This method is similar, but not identical to, activating a form\(cqs
submit \f[CR]<button>\f[R].
When invoking this method directly, however:
.IP \(bu 2
No \f[CR]submit\f[R] event is raised.
In particular, the form\(cqs \f[CR]onsubmit\f[R] event handler is not
run.
.IP \(bu 2
Constraint validation is not triggered.
.PP
The \f[CR]HTMLFormElement.requestSubmit()\f[R] method is identical to
activating a form\(cqs submit \f[CR]<button>\f[R] and does not have
these differences.
.PP
A form control (such as a submit button) with a \f[CR]name\f[R] or
\f[CR]id\f[R] of \f[CR]submit\f[R] will mask the form\(cqs
\f[CR]submit\f[R] method.
Trying to call \f[CR]myForm.submit();\f[R] throws an error \(lqsubmit is
not a function\(rq because in this case \f[CR]submit\f[R] refers to the
form control which has a \f[CR]name\f[R] or \f[CR]id\f[R] of
\f[CR]submit\f[R].
.PP
\f[CR]<input>\f[R] with attribute type=\(lqsubmit\(rq will not be
submitted with the form when using
\f[B]\f[CB]HTMLFormElement.submit()\f[B]\f[R], but it would be submitted
when you do it with original HTML form submit.
