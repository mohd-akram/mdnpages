.SH NAME
Window.rejectionhandled_event \- Window: rejectionhandled event
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]rejectionhandled\f[B]\f[R] event is sent to the
script\(cqs global scope (usually \f[CR]window\f[R] but also
\f[CR]Worker\f[R]) whenever a rejected JavaScript \f[CR]Promise\f[R] is
handled late, i.e., when a handler is attached to the promise after its
rejection had caused an \f[CR]unhandledrejection\f[R] event.
.PP
This can be used in debugging and for general application resiliency, in
tandem with the \f[CR]unhandledrejection\f[R] event, which is sent when
a promise is rejected but there is no handler for the rejection at the
time.
.SH SYNTAX
Use the event name in methods like \f[CR]addEventListener()\f[R], or set
an event handler property.
