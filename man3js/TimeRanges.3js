.SH NAME
TimeRanges \- TimeRanges
.SH SYNOPSIS
When loading a media resource for use by an \f[CR]<audio>\f[R] or
\f[CR]<video>\f[R] element, the \f[B]\f[CB]TimeRanges\f[B]\f[R]
interface is used for representing the time ranges of the media resource
that have been buffered, the time ranges that have been played, and the
time ranges that are seekable.
.PP
A \f[CR]TimeRanges\f[R] object includes one or more ranges of time, each
specified by a starting time offset and an ending time offset.
You reference each time range by using the \f[CR]start()\f[R] and
\f[CR]end()\f[R] methods, passing the index number of the time range you
want to retrieve.
.SH NORMALIZED TIMERANGES OBJECTS
Several members of \f[CR]HTMLMediaElement\f[R] objects return a
\f[B]normalized TimeRanges object\f[R] \[em] which \c
.UR https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/media.html#normalised-timeranges-object
the spec describes
.UE \c
\ as having the following characteristics:
.PP
\f[I]The ranges in such an object are ordered, don\[cq]t overlap, and
don\[cq]t touch (adjacent ranges are folded into one bigger range).
A range can be empty (referencing just a single moment in time).\f[R]
.SH INSTANCE PROPERTIES
.TP
\f[B]TimeRanges.length\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
Returns an \f[CR]unsigned long\f[R] representing the number of time
ranges represented by the time range object.
.SH INSTANCE METHODS
.TP
\f[B]TimeRanges.start()\f[R]
Returns the time for the start of the range with the specified index.
.TP
\f[B]TimeRanges.end()\f[R]
Returns the time for the end of the specified range.
