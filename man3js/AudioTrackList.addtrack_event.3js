.SH EVENT PROPERTIES
\f[I]\f[CI]TrackEvent\f[I] is based on \f[CI]Event\f[I], so properties
of \f[CI]Event\f[I] are also available on \f[CI]TrackEvent\f[I]
objects.\f[R]
.TP
\f[B]track\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
The DOM track object the event is in reference to.
If not \f[CR]null\f[R], this is always an object of one of the media
track types: \f[CR]AudioTrack\f[R], \f[CR]VideoTrack\f[R], or
\f[CR]TextTrack\f[R]).
.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Trigger
The \f[CR]addtrack\f[R] event is called whenever a new track is added to
the media element whose audio tracks are represented by the
\f[CR]AudioTrackList\f[R] object.
This happens when tracks are added to the element when the media is
first attached to the element; one \f[CR]addtrack\f[R] event will occur
for each audio track in the media resource.
.PP
This event is not cancelable and does not bubble.
.SS Use cases
You can use this event to react to a new audio track becoming available.
You may want to update your UI elements to allow for user selection of
the new audio track, for example.

Using \f[CR]addEventListener()\f[R]:
.IP
.EX
\f[B]const\f[R] videoElement = document.querySelector(\[dq]video\[dq]);

videoElement.audioTracks.addEventListener(\[dq]addtrack\[dq], (event) \f[B]=>\f[R] {
  console.log(\[ga]Audio track: ${event.track.label} added\[ga]);
});
