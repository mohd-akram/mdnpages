.SH NAME
Intl.Locale.script \- Intl.Locale.prototype.script
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]script\f[B]\f[R] accessor property of
\f[CR]Intl.Locale\f[R] instances returns the script used for writing the
particular language used in this locale.
.SH DESCRIPTION
Script, sometimes called writing system, is one of the core attributes
of a locale.
It indicates the set of symbols, or glyphs, that are used to write a
particular language.
For instance, the script associated with English is Latin, whereas the
script typically associated with Korean is Hangul.
In many cases, denoting a script is not strictly necessary, since the
language (which is necessary) is only written in a single script.
There are exceptions to this rule, however, and it is important to
indicate the script when multiple scripts are applicable.
The \f[CR]script\f[R] property\(cqs value is set at construction time,
either through the \f[CR]script\f[R] subtag (second part, if present) of
the locale identifier or through the \f[CR]script\f[R] option of the
\f[CR]Intl.Locale()\f[R] constructor.
The latter takes priority if they are both present; and if neither is
present, the property has value \f[CR]undefined\f[R].
.PP
The set accessor of \f[CR]script\f[R] is \f[CR]undefined\f[R].
You cannot change this property directly.
.SH EXAMPLES
Like other locale subtags, the script can be added to the
\f[CR]Intl.Locale\f[R] object via the locale string, or a configuration
object argument to the constructor.
.SS Adding a script via the locale string
The script, if present, is the second part of a valid Unicode language
identifier string, and can be added to the initial locale identifier
string that is passed into the \f[CR]Intl.Locale()\f[R] constructor.
Note that the script is not a required part of a locale identifier.

.EX
\f[B]const\f[R] locale = \f[B]new\f[R] Intl.Locale(\(dqen\-Latn\-US\(dq);
console.log(locale.script); \f[I]// Prints \(dqLatn\(dq\f[R]
.EE
.SS Adding a script via the configuration object argument
The \f[CR]Intl.Locale()\f[R] constructor has an optional configuration
object argument.
Set the \f[CR]script\f[R] property of the configuration object to your
desired script, and then pass it into the constructor.
