.SH NAME
Intl.Locale.script \- Intl.Locale.prototype.script
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]script\f[B]\f[R] accessor property of
\f[CR]Intl.Locale\f[R] instances returns the script used for writing the
particular language used in this locale.
.SH DESCRIPTION
A script, sometimes called writing system, is one of the core attributes
of a locale.
It indicates the set of symbols, or glyphs, that are used to write a
particular language.
For instance, the script associated with English is Latin, whereas the
script typically associated with Korean is Hangul.
In many cases, denoting a script is not strictly necessary, since the
language (which is necessary) is only written in a single script.
There are exceptions to this rule, however, and it is important to
indicate the script whenever possible, in order to have a complete
Unicode language identifier.
.SH EXAMPLES
.SS Setting the script in the locale identifier string argument
The script is the second part of a valid Unicode language identifier
string, and can be set by adding it to the locale identifier string that
is passed into the \f[CR]Intl.Locale()\f[R] constructor.
Note that the script is not a required part of a locale identifier.

.EX
\f[B]const\f[R] locale = \f[B]new\f[R] Intl.Locale(\[dq]en\-Latn\-US\[dq]);
console.log(locale.script); \f[I]// Prints \[dq]Latn\[dq]\f[R]
.EE
.SS Setting the script via the configuration object
The \f[CR]Intl.Locale()\f[R] constructor takes a configuration object,
which can be used to set the script subtag and property.

\f[B]const\f[R] locale = \f[B]new\f[R] Intl.Locale(\[dq]fr\-FR\[dq], { script: \[dq]Latn\[dq] });
