.SH NAME
Document.location \- Document: location property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]Document.location\f[B]\f[R] read\-only property returns a
\f[CR]Location\f[R] object, which contains information about the URL of
the document and provides methods for changing that URL and loading
another URL.
.PP
Though \f[CR]Document.location\f[R] is a \f[I]read\-only\f[R]
\f[CR]Location\f[R] object, you can also assign a string to it.
This means that you can work with document.location as if it were a
string in most cases:
\f[CR]document.location = \[aq]http://www.example.com\[aq]\f[R] is a
synonym of
\f[CR]document.location.href = \[aq]http://www.example.com\[aq]\f[R].
If you assign another string to it, browser will load the website you
assigned.
.PP
To retrieve just the URL as a string, the read\-only
\f[CR]document.URL\f[R] property can also be used.
.PP
If the current document is not in a browsing context, the returned value
is \f[CR]null\f[R].
.SH VALUE
A \f[CR]Location\f[R] object.
