.SH NAME
GPUInternalError \- GPUInternalError
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f[B]Secure context:\f[R] This feature is available only in secure
contexts (HTTPS).
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R] This feature is available in Web Workers.
.PP
The \f[B]\f[CB]GPUInternalError\f[B]\f[R] interface of the WebGPU API
describes an application error indicating that an operation failed for a
system or implementation\-specific reason, even when all validation
requirements were satisfied.
.PP
It represents one of the types of errors surfaced by
\f[CR]GPUDevice.popErrorScope\f[R] and the \f[CR]uncapturederror\f[R]
event.
.PP
Internal errors occur when something happens in the WebGPU
implementation that wasn\(cqt caught by validation and wasn\(cqt clearly
identifiable as an out\-of\-memory error.
It generally means that an operation your code performed hit a system
limit in a way that was difficult to express with WebGPU\(cqs supported
limits.
The same operation might succeed on a different device.
These can only be raised by pipeline creation, usually if the shader is
too complex for the device.
.SH CONSTRUCTOR
.TP
\f[B]GPUInternalError()\f[R]
Creates a new \f[CR]GPUInternalError\f[R] object instance.
.SH INSTANCE PROPERTIES
The \f[CR]message\f[R] property is inherited from its parent,
\f[CR]GPUError\f[R]:
.TP
\f[B]message\f[R] \f[I](experimental)\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
A string providing a human\-readable message that explains why the error
occurred.
.SH EXAMPLES
The following example uses an error scope to capture a suspected
validation error, logging it to the console.
.IP
.EX
device.pushErrorScope(\(dqinternal\(dq);

\f[B]let\f[R] module = device.createShaderModule({
  code: shader, \f[I]// REALLY complex shader\f[R]
});

device.popErrorScope().then((error) \f[B]=>\f[R] {
  \f[B]if\f[R] (error) {
    \f[I]// error is a GPUInternalError object instance\f[R]
    module = \f[B]null\f[R];
    console.error(\(gaAn error occurred while creating shader: ${error.message}\(ga);
  }
});
