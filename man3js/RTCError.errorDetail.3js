.SH NAME
RTCError.errorDetail \- RTCError: errorDetail property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[CR]RTCError\f[R] interface\(cqs read\-only
\f[B]\f[CB]errorDetail\f[B]\f[R] property is a string indicating the
WebRTC\-specific error code that occurred.
.SH VALUE
A read\-only string whose value indicates the type of WebRTC\-specific
error that occurred on an \f[CR]RTCPeerConnection\f[R].
The possible values are:
.TP
\f[B]data\-channel\-failure\f[R]
The connection\(cqs \f[CR]RTCDataChannel\f[R] has failed.
.TP
\f[B]dtls\-failure\f[R]
The negotiation of the DTLS connection failed, or the connection was
terminated with a fatal error.
The error\(cqs \f[CR]message\f[R] contains details about the nature of
the error.
If a fatal error is \f[I]received\f[R], the error object\(cqs
\f[CR]receivedAlert\f[R] property is set to the value of the DTLSL alert
received.
If, on the other hand, a fatal error was \f[I]sent\f[R], the
\f[CR]sentAlert\f[R] is set to the alert\(cqs value.
.TP
\f[B]fingerprint\-failure\f[R]
The remote certificate for the \f[CR]RTCDtlsTransport\f[R] didn\(cqt
match any of the fingerprints listed in the SDP.
If the remote peer can\(cqt match the local certificate against the
provided fingerprints, this error doesn\(cqt occur, though this
situation may result instead in a \f[CR]dtls\-failure\f[R] error.
.TP
\f[B]hardware\-encoder\-error\f[R]
The hardware encoder doesn\(cqt support the given configuration
parameters.
.TP
\f[B]hardware\-encoder\-not\-available\f[R]
The hardware encoder resources required to accomplish the requested
operation aren\(cqt available.
.TP
\f[B]sctp\-failure\f[R]
The SCTP negotiation has failed, or the connection has terminated with a
fatal error.
The SCTP cause code can be found in the \f[CR]RTCError\f[R] object\(cqs
\f[CR]sctpCauseCode\f[R].
SCTP error cause codes 1\-13 are defined in the SCTP specification: RFC
4960, section 3.3.10).
.TP
\f[B]sdp\-syntax\-error\f[R]
The SDP syntax is invalid.
The error\(cqs \f[CR]sdpLineNumber\f[R] property indicates the line
number within the SDP at which the error was detected.
