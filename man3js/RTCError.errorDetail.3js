.SH NAME
RTCError.errorDetail \- RTCError: errorDetail property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[CR]RTCError\f[R] interface\[cq]s read\-only
\f[B]\f[CB]errorDetail\f[B]\f[R] property is a string indicating the
WebRTC\-specific error code that occurred.
.SH VALUE
A read\-only string whose value indicates the type of WebRTC\-specific
error that occurred on an \f[CR]RTCPeerConnection\f[R].
The possible values are:
.TP
\f[B]data\-channel\-failure\f[R]
The connection\[cq]s \f[CR]RTCDataChannel\f[R] has failed.
.TP
\f[B]dtls\-failure\f[R]
The negotiation of the DTLS connection failed, or the connection was
terminated with a fatal error.
The error\[cq]s \f[CR]message\f[R] contains details about the nature of
the error.
If a fatal error is \f[I]received\f[R], the error object\[cq]s
\f[CR]receivedAlert\f[R] property is set to the value of the DTLSL alert
received.
If, on the other hand, a fatal error was \f[I]sent\f[R], the
\f[CR]sentAlert\f[R] is set to the alert\[cq]s value.
.TP
\f[B]fingerprint\-failure\f[R]
The remote certificate for the \f[CR]RTCDtlsTransport\f[R] didn\[cq]t
match any of the fingerprints listed in the SDP.
If the remote peer can\[cq]t match the local certificate against the
provided fingerprints, this error doesn\[cq]t occur, though this
situation may result instead in a \f[CR]dtls\-failure\f[R] error.
.TP
\f[B]hardware\-encoder\-error\f[R]
The hardware encoder doesn\[cq]t support the given configuration
parameters.
.TP
\f[B]hardware\-encoder\-not\-available\f[R]
The hardware encoder resources required to accomplish the requested
operation aren\[cq]t available.
.TP
\f[B]sctp\-failure\f[R]
The SCTP negotiation has failed, or the connection has terminated with a
fatal error.
The SCTP cause code can be found in the \f[CR]RTCError\f[R] object\[cq]s
\f[CR]sctpCauseCode\f[R].
SCTP error cause codes 1\-13 are defined in the SCTP specification: RFC
4960, section 3.3.10).
.TP
\f[B]sdp\-syntax\-error\f[R]
The SDP syntax is invalid.
The error\[cq]s \f[CR]sdpLineNumber\f[R] property indicates the line
number within the SDP at which the error was detected.
