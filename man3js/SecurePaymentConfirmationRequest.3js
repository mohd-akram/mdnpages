An instance of this dictionary must be passed into the
\f[CR]PaymentRequest()\f[R] constructor as the value of the

.TP
\f[B]challenge\f[R]
An \f[CR]ArrayBuffer\f[R], \f[CR]TypedArray\f[R], or \f[CR]DataView\f[R]
provided by the relying party\[cq]s server and used as a \c
.UR https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Challenge%E2%80%93response_authentication

.UE \c
\&.
This value will be signed by the authenticator and the signature will be

with the relying party for authenticating during a payment with the
associated \f[CR]instrument\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]extensions\f[R] \f[I](optional)\f[R]
Any WebAuthn extensions that should be used for the passed
credential(s).
The caller does not need to specify the \f[CR]payment\f[R] extension;
this is added automatically.

An optional list of well\-formed RFC 5646: Tags for Identifying
Languages (also known as BCP 47) language tags, in descending order of
priority, that identify the local preferences of the website.
That is, this represents a language priority list RFC 4647: Matching of
Language Tags, which the user agent can use to perform language
negotiation and locale\-affected formatting with the caller.
> \f[B]Note:\f[R] > The locale is distinct from language or direction
metadata associated with specific input members, in that it represents
the caller\[cq]s requested localized experience rather than assertion
about a specific string value.
