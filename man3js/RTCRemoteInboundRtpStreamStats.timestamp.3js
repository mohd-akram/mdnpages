RTCRemoteInboundRtpStreamStats: timestamp property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]timestamp\f[B]\f[R] property of the
\f[CR]RTCRemoteInboundRtpStreamStats\f[R] dictionary is a
\f[CR]DOMHighResTimeStamp\f[R] object specifying the time at which the
data in the object was sampled.
.PP
For this object the timestamp is the time at which the \f[I]RTCP
Receiver Report (RR)\f[R] was received at the local end of the
communication (the RR report is defined in RFC 3550, section 6.4.2)).
.SH VALUE
A \f[CR]DOMHighResTimeStamp\f[R] value indicating the time at which the
activity described by the statistics in this object was recorded, in
milliseconds elapsed since the beginning of January 1, 1970, UTC.
.PP
The value should be accurate to within a few milliseconds but may not be
entirely precise, either because of hardware or operating system
limitations or because of fingerprinting protection in the form of
reduced clock precision or accuracy.
