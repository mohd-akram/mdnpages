.SH NAME
Request.clone \- Request: clone() method
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f[B]Note:\f[R] This feature is available in Web Workers.
.PP
The \f[B]\f[CB]clone()\f[B]\f[R] method of the \f[CR]Request\f[R]
interface creates a copy of the current \f[CR]Request\f[R] object.
.PP
Like the underlying \f[CR]ReadableStream.tee\f[R] api, the
\f[CR]body\f[R] of a cloned \f[CR]Request\f[R] will signal backpressure
at the rate of the \f[I]faster\f[R] consumer of the two bodies, and
unread data is enqueued internally on the slower consumed
\f[CR]body\f[R] without any limit or backpressure.
Beware when you construct a \f[CR]Request\f[R] from a stream and then
\f[CR]clone\f[R] it.
.PP
\f[CR]clone()\f[R] throws a \f[CR]TypeError\f[R] if the request body has
already been used.
In fact, the main reason \f[CR]clone()\f[R] exists is to allow multiple
uses of body objects (when they are one\-use only.)
.PP
If you intend to modify the request, you may prefer the
\f[CR]Request\f[R] constructor.
.SH SYNTAX

clone()
.EE
.SS Parameters
None.
.SS Return value
A \f[CR]Request\f[R] object, which is an exact copy of the
\f[CR]Request\f[R] that \f[CR]clone()\f[R] was called on.
.SH EXAMPLES
In the following snippet, we create a new request using the
\f[CR]Request()\f[R] constructor (for an image file in the same
directory as the script), then clone the request.
.IP
.EX
\f[B]const\f[R] myRequest = \f[B]new\f[R] Request(\[dq]flowers.jpg\[dq]);
\f[B]const\f[R] newRequest = myRequest.clone(); \f[I]// a copy of the request is now stored in newRequest\f[R]
