.SH NAME
HTMLImageElement.srcset \- HTMLImageElement: srcset property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[CR]HTMLImageElement\f[R] property \f[B]\f[CB]srcset\f[B]\f[R] is
a string which identifies one or more \f[B]image candidate strings\f[R],
separated using commas (\f[CR],\f[R]) each specifying image resources to
use under given circumstances.
.PP
Each image candidate string contains an image URL and an optional width
or pixel density descriptor that indicates the conditions under which
that candidate should be used instead of the image specified by the
\f[CR]src\f[R] property.
.PP
The \f[CR]srcset\f[R] property, along with the \f[CR]sizes\f[R]
property, are a crucial component in designing responsive websites, as
they can be used together to make pages that use appropriate images for
the rendering situation.
.RS
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R] If the \f[CR]srcset\f[R] attribute uses width
descriptors, the \f[CR]sizes\f[R] attribute must also be present, or the
\f[CR]srcset\f[R] itself will be ignored.
.RE
.SH VALUE
A string containing a comma\-separated list of one or more image
candidate strings to be used when determining which image resource to
present inside the \f[CR]<img>\f[R] element represented by the
\f[CR]HTMLImageElement\f[R].
.PP
Each image candidate string must begin with a valid URL referencing a
non\-interactive graphic resource.
This is followed by whitespace and then a condition descriptor that
indicates the circumstances in which the indicated image should be used.
Space characters, other than the whitespace separating the URL and the
corresponding condition descriptor, are ignored; this includes both
leading and trailing space, as well as space before or after each comma.
.PP
The condition descriptor may take one of two forms:
.IP \[bu] 2
To indicate that the image resource specified by the image candidate
string should be used when the image is being rendered with a particular
width in pixels, provide a \f[B]width descriptor\f[R] comprised the
number giving that width in pixels followed by the lower case letter
\[lq]w\[rq].
For example, to provide an image resource to be used when the renderer
needs a 450 pixel wide image, use the width descriptor string
\f[CR]450w\f[R].
The specified width must be a positive, non\-zero, integer, and
\f[I]must\f[R] match the intrinsic width of the referenced image.
When a \f[CR]srcset\f[R] contains \[lq]w\[rq] descriptors, the browser
uses those descriptors together with the \f[CR]sizes\f[R] attribute to
pick a resource.
.IP \[bu] 2
Alternatively, you can use a \f[B]pixel density descriptor\f[R], which
specifies the condition in which the corresponding image resource should
be used as the display\[cq]s pixel density.
This is written by stating the pixel density as a positive, non\-zero
floating\-point value followed by the lower\-case letter \[lq]x\[rq].
As an example, to state that the corresponding image should be used when
the pixel density is double the standard density, you can give the pixel
density descriptor \f[CR]2x\f[R] or \f[CR]2.0x\f[R].
.PP
If the condition descriptor is not provided (in other words, the image
candidate provides only a URL), the candidate is assigned a default
descriptor of \[lq]1x\[rq].
.IP
.EX
\[dq]images/team\-photo.jpg, images/team\-photo\-retina.jpg 2x\[dq]
.EE
.PP
This string provides versions of an image to be used at the standard
pixel density (undescribed, assigned a default of \f[CR]1x\f[R]) as well
as double that pixel density (\f[CR]2x\f[R]).
.PP
When an image element\[cq]s \f[CR]srcset\f[R] contains \[lq]x\[rq]
descriptors, browsers also consider the URL in the \f[CR]src\f[R]
attribute (if present) as a candidate, and assign it a default
descriptor of \f[CR]1x\f[R].
.IP
.EX
\[dq]header640.png 640w, header960.png 960w, header1024.png 1024w\[dq]
.EE
.PP
This string provides versions of a header image to use when the user
agent\[cq]s renderer needs an image of width 640px, 960px, or 1024px.
.PP
Note that if any resource in a \f[CR]srcset\f[R] is described with a
\[lq]w\[rq] descriptor, all resources within that \f[CR]srcset\f[R] must
also be described with \[lq]w\[rq] descriptors, and the image
element\[cq]s \f[CR]src\f[R] is not considered a candidate.
.SH EXAMPLES
.SS HTML
The HTML below indicates that the default image resource, contained
within the \f[CR]src\f[R] attribute should be used for 1x displays, and
that a 400\-pixel version (contained within the \f[CR]srcset\f[R], and
assigned a \f[CR]2x\f[R] descriptor) should be used for 2x displays.
.IP
.EX
<\f[B]div\f[R] class=\[dq]box\[dq]>
  <\f[B]img\f[R]
    src=\[dq]/en\-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img/clock\-demo\-200px.png\[dq]
    alt=\[dq]Clock\[dq]
    srcset=\[dq]/en\-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img/clock\-demo\-400px.png 2x\[dq] />
</\f[B]div\f[R]>
.EE
.SS CSS
The CSS specifies that the image and its surrounding box should be 200
pixels square and should have a simple border around it.
Also provided is the \f[CR]word\-break\f[R] attribute, using the
\f[CR]break\-all\f[R] value to tell the browser to wrap the string
within the width available regardless of where in the string the wrap
must occur.
.IP
.EX
\&.box {
  \f[B]width\f[R]: 200px;
  \f[B]border\f[R]: 2px solid rgb(150 150 150);
  \f[B]padding\f[R]: 0.5em;
  \f[B]word\-break\f[R]: break\-all;
}

\&.box img {
  \f[B]width\f[R]: 200px;
}
.EE
.SS JavaScript
The following code is run within a handler for the
\f[CR]window\f[R]\[cq]s \f[CR]load\f[R] event.
It uses the image\[cq]s \f[CR]currentSrc\f[R] property to fetch and
display the URL selected by the browser from the \f[CR]srcset\f[R].
.IP
.EX
window.addEventListener(\[dq]load\[dq], () \f[B]=>\f[R] {
  \f[B]let\f[R] box = document.querySelector(\[dq].box\[dq]);
  \f[B]let\f[R] image = box.querySelector(\[dq]img\[dq]);

  \f[B]let\f[R] newElem = document.createElement(\[dq]p\[dq]);
  newElem.innerHTML = \[ga]Image: <code>${image.currentSrc}</code>\[ga];
  box.appendChild(newElem);
});
.EE
.SS Result
In the displayed output below, the selected URL will correspond with
whether your display results in selecting the 1x or the 2x version of
the image.
If you happen to have both standard and high density displays, try
moving this window between them and reloading the page to see the
results change.
