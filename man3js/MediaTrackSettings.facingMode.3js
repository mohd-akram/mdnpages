.SH NAME
MediaTrackSettings.facingMode \- MediaTrackSettings: facingMode property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[CR]MediaTrackSettings\f[R] dictionary\(cqs
\f[B]\f[CB]facingMode\f[B]\f[R] property is a string indicating the
direction in which the camera producing the video track represented by
the \f[CR]MediaStreamTrack\f[R] is currently facing.
This lets you determine what value was selected to comply with your
specified constraints for this property\(cqs value as described in the
\f[CR]MediaTrackConstraints.facingMode\f[R] property you provided when
calling either \f[CR]getUserMedia()\f[R] or
\f[CR]MediaStreamTrack.applyConstraints()\f[R].
.PP
If needed, you can determine whether or not this constraint is supported
by checking the value of
\f[CR]MediaTrackSupportedConstraints.facingMode\f[R] as returned by a
call to \f[CR]MediaDevices.getSupportedConstraints()\f[R].
However, typically this is unnecessary since browsers will ignore any
constraints they\(cqre unfamiliar with.
.PP
Because RTP doesn\(cqt include this information, tracks associated with
a WebRTC \f[CR]RTCPeerConnection\f[R] will never include this property.
.SH VALUE
A string whose value is one of the strings in
\f[CR]VideoFacingModeEnum\f[R].
.SS VideoFacingModeEnum
The following strings are permitted values for the facing mode.
These may represent separate cameras, or they may represent directions
in which an adjustable camera can be pointed.
.TP
\f[B]\(dquser\(dq\f[R]
The video source is facing toward the user; this includes, for example,
the front\-facing camera on a smartphone.
.TP
\f[B]\(dqenvironment\(dq\f[R]
The video source is facing away from the user, thereby viewing their
environment.
This is the back camera on a smartphone.
.TP
\f[B]\(dqleft\(dq\f[R]
The video source is facing toward the user but to their left, such as a
camera aimed toward the user but over their left shoulder.
.TP
\f[B]\(dqright\(dq\f[R]
The video source is facing toward the user but to their right, such as a
camera aimed toward the user but over their right shoulder.
