TrustedScript \- TrustedScript
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f[B]Note:\f[R] This feature is available in Web Workers.
.PP
The \f[B]\f[CB]TrustedScript\f[B]\f[R] interface of the Trusted Types
API represents a string with an uncompiled script body that a developer
can insert into an injection sink that might execute the script.
These objects are created via
\f[CR]TrustedTypePolicy.createScript()\f[R] and therefore have no
constructor.
.PP
The value of a \f[B]TrustedScript\f[R] object is set when the object is
created and cannot be changed by JavaScript as there is no setter
exposed.
.SH INSTANCE METHODS
.TP
\f[B]TrustedScript.toJSON()\f[R]
Returns a JSON representation of the stored data.
.TP
\f[B]TrustedScript.toString()\f[R]
A string containing the sanitized script.
.SH EXAMPLES
The constant \f[CR]sanitized\f[R] is an object created via a Trusted
Types policy.
