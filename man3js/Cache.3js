.SH SYNOPSIS
\f[B]Secure context:\f[R] This feature is available only in secure
contexts (HTTPS).
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R] This feature is available in Web Workers.
.PP
The \f[B]\f[CB]Cache\f[B]\f[R] interface provides a persistent storage
mechanism for \f[CR]Request\f[R] / \f[CR]Response\f[R] object pairs that
are cached in long lived memory.
How long a \f[CR]Cache\f[R] object lives is browser dependent, but a
single origin\[cq]s scripts can typically rely on the presence of a
previously populated \f[CR]Cache\f[R] object.
Note that the \f[CR]Cache\f[R] interface is exposed to windowed scopes
as well as workers.
You don\[cq]t have to use it in conjunction with service workers, even
though it is defined in the service worker spec.
.PP
An origin can have multiple, named \f[CR]Cache\f[R] objects.
You are responsible for implementing how your script (e.g.\ in a
\f[CR]ServiceWorker\f[R]) handles \f[CR]Cache\f[R] updates.
Items in a \f[CR]Cache\f[R] do not get updated unless explicitly
requested; they don\[cq]t expire unless deleted.
Use \f[CR]CacheStorage.open()\f[R] to open a specific named
\f[CR]Cache\f[R] object and then call any of the \f[CR]Cache\f[R]
methods to maintain the \f[CR]Cache\f[R].
.PP
You are also responsible for periodically purging cache entries.
Each browser has a hard limit on the amount of cache storage that a
given origin can use.
\f[CR]Cache\f[R] quota usage estimates are available via the
\f[CR]StorageManager.estimate()\f[R] method.
The browser does its best to manage disk space, but it may delete the
\f[CR]Cache\f[R] storage for an origin.
The browser will generally delete all of the data for an origin or none
of the data for an origin.
Make sure to version caches by name and use the caches only from the
version of the script that they can safely operate on.
See Deleting old caches for more information.

\f[B]Note:\f[R] The key matching algorithm depends on the \c
.UR https://www.fastly.com/blog/best-practices-using-vary-header
VARY header
.UE \c
\ in the value.
So matching a new key requires looking at both key and value for entries
in the \f[CR]Cache\f[R] object.

.SH INSTANCE METHODS
.TP
\f[B]Cache.match()\f[R]
Returns a \f[CR]Promise\f[R] that resolves to the response associated
with the first matching request in the \f[CR]Cache\f[R] object.
.TP
\f[B]Cache.matchAll()\f[R]
Returns a \f[CR]Promise\f[R] that resolves to an array of all matching
responses in the \f[CR]Cache\f[R] object.
.TP
\f[B]Cache.add()\f[R]
Takes a URL, retrieves it and adds the resulting response object to the
given cache.
This is functionally equivalent to calling \f[CR]fetch()\f[R], then
using \f[CR]put()\f[R] to add the results to the cache.
.TP
\f[B]Cache.addAll()\f[R]
Takes an array of URLs, retrieves them, and adds the resulting response
objects to the given cache.
.TP
\f[B]Cache.put()\f[R]
Takes both a request and its response and adds it to the given cache.
.TP
\f[B]Cache.delete()\f[R]
Finds the \f[CR]Cache\f[R] entry whose key is the request, returning a
\f[CR]Promise\f[R] that resolves to \f[CR]true\f[R] if a matching
\f[CR]Cache\f[R] entry is found and deleted.
If no \f[CR]Cache\f[R] entry is found, the promise resolves to
\f[CR]false\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]Cache.keys()\f[R]
Returns a \f[CR]Promise\f[R] that resolves to an array of
\f[CR]Cache\f[R] keys.
.SH EXAMPLES
This code snippet is from the \c
.UR https://github.com/GoogleChrome/samples/blob/gh-pages/service-worker/selective-caching/service-worker.js
service worker selective caching sample
.UE \c
\&.
(see \c
.UR https://googlechrome.github.io/samples/service-worker/selective-caching/
selective caching live
.UE \c
) The code uses \f[CR]CacheStorage.open()\f[R] to open any
\f[CR]Cache\f[R] objects with a \f[CR]Content\-Type\f[R] header that
starts with \f[CR]font/\f[R].
.PP
The code then uses \f[CR]Cache.match()\f[R] to see if there\[cq]s
already a matching font in the cache, and if so, returns it.
If there isn\[cq]t a matching font, the code fetches the font from the
network and uses \f[CR]Cache.put()\f[R] to cache the fetched resource.
.PP
The code handles exceptions thrown from the \f[CR]fetch()\f[R]
operation.
Note that an HTTP error response (e.g., 404) will not trigger an
exception.
It will return a normal response object that has the appropriate error
code.
.PP
The code snippet also shows a best practice for versioning caches used
by the service worker.
Though there\[cq]s only one cache in this example, the same approach can
be used for multiple caches.
It maps a shorthand identifier for a cache to a specific, versioned
cache name.
The code also deletes all caches that aren\[cq]t named in
\f[CR]CURRENT_CACHES\f[R].
.PP
In the code example, \f[CR]caches\f[R] is a property of the
\f[CR]ServiceWorkerGlobalScope\f[R].
It holds the \f[CR]CacheStorage\f[R] object, by which it can access the
\f[CR]CacheStorage\f[R] interface.

.EE
.SS Cookies and Cache objects
The Fetch API requires \f[CR]Set\-Cookie\f[R] headers to be stripped
before returning a \f[CR]Response\f[R] object from \f[CR]fetch()\f[R].
So a \f[CR]Response\f[R] stored in a \f[CR]Cache\f[R] won\[cq]t contain
\f[CR]Set\-Cookie\f[R] headers, and therefore won\[cq]t cause any
cookies to be stored.
