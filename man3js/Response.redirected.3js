.SH NAME
Response.redirected \- Response: redirected property
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f[B]Note:\f[R] This feature is available in Web Workers.
.PP
The \f[B]\f[CB]redirected\f[B]\f[R] read\-only property of the
\f[CR]Response\f[R] interface indicates whether or not the response is
the result of a request you made which was redirected.
.RS
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R] Checking \f[CR]redirected\f[R] to prevent redirects is
not recommended, because by the time a response is received, the
redirect has already happened, and you may have sent the request to an
unintended destination, potentially sending sensitive information.
Instead, you should do the filtering when you call \f[CR]fetch()\f[R].
See the example Disallowing redirects, which shows this being done.
.RE
.SH VALUE
A boolean value which is \f[CR]true\f[R] if the response indicates that
your request was redirected.
.SH EXAMPLES
.SS Detecting redirects
Checking to see if the response comes from a redirected request is as
simple as checking this flag on the \f[CR]Response\f[R] object.
In the code below, a textual message is inserted into an element when a
redirect occurred during the fetch operation.
Note, however, that this isn\(cqt as safe as outright rejecting
redirects if they\(cqre unexpected, as described under Disallowing
redirects below.
.PP
The \f[CR]url\f[R] property returns the final URL after redirects.
.IP
.EX
fetch(\(dqawesome\-picture.jpg\(dq)
  .then((response) \f[B]=>\f[R] {
    \f[B]const\f[R] elem = document.getElementById(\(dqwarning\-message\-box\(dq);
    elem.textContent = response.redirected ? \(dqUnexpected redirect\(dq : \(dq\(dq;
    \f[I]// final url obtained after redirects\f[R]
    console.log(response.url);
    \f[B]return\f[R] response.blob();
  })
  .then((imageBlob) \f[B]=>\f[R] {
    \f[B]const\f[R] imgObjectURL = URL.createObjectURL(imageBlob);
    document.getElementById(\(dqimg\-element\-id\(dq).src = imgObjectURL;
  });
.EE
.SS Disallowing redirects
Checking \f[CR]redirected\f[R] is a bad way to prevent redirects,
because the redirect has already happened.
Instead, you should set the redirect mode to \f[CR]\(dqerror\(dq\f[R] in
the \f[CR]options\f[R] parameter when calling \f[CR]fetch()\f[R], like
this:
.IP
.EX
fetch(\(dqawesome\-picture.jpg\(dq, { redirect: \(dqerror\(dq })
  .then((response) \f[B]=>\f[R] response.blob())
  .then((imageBlob) \f[B]=>\f[R] {
    \f[B]const\f[R] imgObjectURL = URL.createObjectURL(imageBlob);
    document.getElementById(\(dqimg\-element\-id\(dq).src = imgObjectURL;
  });
