XRSpace \- XRSpace
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f[B]Secure context:\f[R] This feature is available only in secure
contexts (HTTPS).
.PP
The \f[B]\f[CB]XRSpace\f[B]\f[R] interface of the WebXR Device API is an
abstract interface providing a common basis for every class which
represents a virtual coordinate system within the virtual world, in
which its origin corresponds to a physical location.
Spatial data in WebXR is always expressed relative to an object based
upon one of the descendant interfaces of \f[CR]XRSpace\f[R], at the time
at which a given \f[CR]XRFrame\f[R] takes place.
.PP
Numeric values such as pose positions are thus coordinates in the
corresponding \f[CR]XRSpace\f[R], relative to that space\[cq]s origin.
.RS
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R] The \f[CR]XRSpace\f[R] interface is never used directly;
instead, all spaces are created using one of the interfaces based on
\f[CR]XRSpace\f[R].
At this time, those are \f[CR]XRReferenceSpace\f[R],
\f[CR]XRBoundedReferenceSpace\f[R], and \f[CR]XRJointSpace\f[R].

.SH INTERFACES BASED ON XRSPACE
Below is a list of interfaces based on the \f[CR]XRSpace\f[R] interface.
.TP
\f[B]XRBoundedReferenceSpace\f[R]
Represents a reference space which may move within a region of space
whose borders are defined by an array of points laid out in clockwise
order along the floor to define the passable region of the space.
The origin of an \f[CR]XRBoundedReferenceSpace\f[R] is always at floor
level, with its X and Z coordinates typically defaulting to a location
near the room\[cq]s center.
.TP
\f[B]XRReferenceSpace\f[R]
Represents a reference space which is typically expected to remain
static for the duration of the \f[CR]XRSession\f[R].
While objects may move within the space, the space itself remains fixed
in place.
There are exceptions to this static nature; most commonly, an
\f[CR]XRReferenceSpace\f[R] may move in order to adjust based on
reconfiguration of the user\[cq]s headset or other motion\-sensitive
device.
.TP
\f[B]XRJointSpace\f[R]
Represents the space of an \f[CR]XRHand\f[R] joint.
.SH INSTANCE PROPERTIES
\f[I]The \f[CI]XRSpace\f[I] interface defines no properties of its own;
however, it does inherit the properties of its parent interface,
\f[CI]EventTarget\f[I].\f[R]
.SH INSTANCE METHODS
\f[I]The \f[CI]XRSpace\f[I] interface provides no methods of its own.
However, it inherits the methods of \f[CI]EventTarget\f[I], its parent
interface.\f[R]
