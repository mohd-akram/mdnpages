.SH NAME
Intl.Locale.getWeekInfo \- Intl.Locale.prototype.getWeekInfo()
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]getWeekInfo()\f[B]\f[R] method of \f[CR]Intl.Locale\f[R]
instances returns a \f[CR]weekInfo\f[R] object with the properties
\f[CR]firstDay\f[R], \f[CR]weekend\f[R] and \f[CR]minimalDays\f[R] for
this locale.
.RS
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R] In some versions of some browsers, this method was
implemented as an accessor property called \f[CR]weekInfo\f[R].
However, because it returns a new object on each access, it is now
implemented as a method to prevent the situation of
\f[CR]locale.weekInfo === locale.weekInfo\f[R] returning
\f[CR]false\f[R].
Check the browser compatibility table for details.

An object representing week information associated with the Locale data
specified in \c

\&.
It has the following properties:
.TP
\f[B]firstDay\f[R]
An integer between 1 (Monday) and 7 (Sunday) indicating the first day of
the week for the locale.
Commonly 1, 5, 6, or 7.
.TP
\f[B]weekend\f[R]
An array of integers between 1 and 7 indicating the weekend days for the
locale.
This is usually continuous because UTS 35 stores \f[CR]weekendStart\f[R]
and \f[CR]weekendEnd\f[R] instead.
.TP
\f[B]minimalDays\f[R]
An integer between 1 and 7 (commonly 1 and 4) indicating the minimal
days required in the first week of a month or year, for week\-of\-year
or week\-of\-month calculations (e.g.\ The 20th week of the year).
For example, in the \c
.UR https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601
ISO 8601
.UE \c
\ calendar, the first week of a year must have at least 4 days in this
year, so if January 1 is a Friday, Saturday, or Sunday, it will be
numbered as part of the last week of the previous year.
