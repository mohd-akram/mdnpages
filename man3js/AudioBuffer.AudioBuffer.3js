.SH NAME
AudioBuffer.AudioBuffer \- AudioBuffer: AudioBuffer() constructor
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]AudioBuffer\f[B]\f[R] constructor of the Web Audio API
creates a new \f[CR]AudioBuffer\f[R] object.
.SH SYNTAX
.IP
.EX
new AudioBuffer(options)
.EE
.SS Parameters
.TP
\f[B]options\f[R]
Options are as follows:
.RS
.TP
\f[B]length\f[R]
The size of the audio buffer in sample\-frames.
To determine the \f[CR]length\f[R] to use for a specific number of
seconds of audio, use \f[CR]numSeconds * sampleRate\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]numberOfChannels\f[R]
The number of channels for the buffer.
The default is 1, and all user agents are required to support at least
32 channels.
.TP
\f[B]sampleRate\f[R]
The sample rate in Hz for the buffer.
The default is the sample rate of the \f[CR]context\f[R] used in
constructing this object.
User agents are required to support sample rates from 8,000 Hz to 96,000
Hz (but are allowed to go farther outside this range).
.TP
\f[B]channelCount\f[R]
Represents an integer used to determine how many channels are used when
up\-mixing and down\-mixing connections to any inputs to the node.
(See \f[CR]AudioNode.channelCount\f[R] for more information.)
Its usage and precise definition depend on the value of
\f[CR]channelCountMode\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]channelCountMode\f[R]
Represents an enumerated value describing the way channels must be
matched between the node\[cq]s inputs and outputs.
(See \f[CR]AudioNode.channelCountMode\f[R] for more information
including default values.)
.TP
\f[B]channelInterpretation\f[R]
Represents an enumerated value describing the meaning of the channels.
This interpretation will define how audio up\-mixing and down\-mixing
will happen.
The possible values are \f[CR]\[dq]speakers\[dq]\f[R] or
\f[CR]\[dq]discrete\[dq]\f[R].
(See \f[CR]AudioNode.channelCountMode\f[R] for more information
including default values.)
.RE
.SS Deprecated parameters
.TP
\f[B]context\f[R] \f[I](deprecated)\f[R]
A reference to an \f[CR]AudioContext\f[R].
This parameter was removed from the spec.
.SS Exceptions
.TP
\f[B]NotSupportedError\f[R] \f[B]DOMException\f[R]
Thrown if one or more of the options are negative or otherwise has an
invalid value (such as \f[CR]numberOfChannels\f[R] being higher than
supported, or a \f[CR]sampleRate\f[R] outside the nominal range).
.TP
\f[B]RangeError\f[R]
Thrown if there isn\[cq]t enough memory available to allocate the
buffer.
