event is sent once the closing process is complete.
.SH EXAMPLES
This example updates a connection status interface when the
\f[CR]closing\f[R] event arrives.

First, an example using \f[CR]addEventListener()\f[R]:
.IP
.EX
dataChannel.addEventListener(\(dqclosing\(dq, (ev) \f[B]=>\f[R] {
  myConnectionStatus.icon = closingIcon;
  myConnectionStatus.text = \(dqConnection closing\(dq;
});
.EE

You can also set the \f[CR]onclosing\f[R] event handler property
directly:
.IP

pc.onclosing = (ev) \f[B]=>\f[R] {
  myConnectionStatus.icon = closingIcon;
  myConnectionStatus.text = \(dqConnection closing\(dq;
};
