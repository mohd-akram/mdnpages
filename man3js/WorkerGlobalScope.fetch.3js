.SH NAME
WorkerGlobalScope.fetch \- WorkerGlobalScope: fetch() method
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f[B]Note:\f[R] This feature is only available in Web Workers.
.PP
The \f[B]\f[CB]fetch()\f[B]\f[R] method of the
\f[CR]WorkerGlobalScope\f[R] interface starts the process of fetching a
resource from the network, returning a promise that is fulfilled once
the response is available.
.PP
The promise resolves to the \f[CR]Response\f[R] object representing the
response to your request.
.PP
A \f[CR]fetch()\f[R] promise only rejects when the request fails, for
example, because of a badly\-formed request URL or a network error.
A \f[CR]fetch()\f[R] promise \f[I]does not\f[R] reject if the server
responds with HTTP status codes that indicate errors (\f[CR]404\f[R],
\f[CR]504\f[R], etc.).
Instead, a \f[CR]then()\f[R] handler must check the
\f[CR]Response.ok\f[R] and/or \f[CR]Response.status\f[R] properties.
.PP
The \f[CR]fetch()\f[R] method is controlled by the
\f[CR]connect\-src\f[R] directive of Content Security Policy rather than
the directive of the resources it\[cq]s retrieving.
.RS
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R] The \f[CR]fetch()\f[R] method\[cq]s parameters are
identical to those of the \f[CR]Request()\f[R] constructor.
