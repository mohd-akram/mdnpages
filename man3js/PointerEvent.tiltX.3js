.SH NAME
PointerEvent.tiltX \- PointerEvent: tiltX property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]tiltX\f[B]\f[R] read\-only property of the
\f[CR]PointerEvent\f[R] interface is the angle (in degrees) between the
\f[I]Y\-Z plane\f[R] of the pointer and the screen.
This property is typically only useful for a pen/stylus pointer type.
.PP
Depending on the specific hardware and platform, user agents will likely
only receive one set of values for the transducer orientation relative
to the screen plane \[em] either \f[CR]tiltX\f[R] and \f[CR]tiltY\f[R]
or \f[CR]altitudeAngle\f[R] and \f[CR]azimuthAngle\f[R].

\&.
.SH VALUE
The angle in degrees between the Y\-Z plane of the pointer (stylus) and
the screen.
The range of values is \f[CR]\-90\f[R] to \f[CR]90\f[R], inclusive,
where a positive value is a tilt to the right.
For devices that do not support this property, the value is
\f[CR]0\f[R].
.SH EXAMPLES
This example illustrates simple accessing of the \f[CR]tiltX\f[R] and
\f[CR]tiltY\f[R] properties.
