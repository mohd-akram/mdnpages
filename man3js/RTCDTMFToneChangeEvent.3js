.SH NAME
RTCDTMFToneChangeEvent \- RTCDTMFToneChangeEvent
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]RTCDTMFToneChangeEvent\f[B]\f[R] interface represents
events sent to indicate that DTMF tones have started or finished
playing.
This interface is used by the \f[CR]tonechange\f[R] event.
.SH INSTANCE PROPERTIES
\f[I]In addition to the properties of \f[CI]Event\f[I], this interface
offers the following:\f[R]
.TP
\f[B]RTCDTMFToneChangeEvent.tone\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
A string specifying the tone which has begun playing, or an empty string
(\f[CR]\(dq\(dq\f[R]) if the previous tone has finished playing.
.SH CONSTRUCTORS
.TP
\f[B]RTCDTMFToneChangeEvent()\f[R]
Returns a new \f[CR]RTCDTMFToneChangeEvent\f[R].
It takes two parameters, the first being a string representing the type
of the event (always \f[CR]\(dqtonechange\(dq\f[R]); the second a
dictionary containing the initial state of the properties of the event.
.SH INSTANCE METHODS
\f[I]Supports the methods defined in \f[CI]Event\f[I].
There are no additional methods.\f[R]
.SH EXAMPLES
This snippet is derived loosely from the full, working example you\(cqll
find in the section on When a tone finishes playing.
It appends each tone to a display box as it\(cqs played, and, once all
tones have been sent, re\-enabled a previously\-disabled \(lqSend\(rq
button, allowing the next DTMF string to be entered.
