.SH NAME
Window.pagehide_event \- Window: pagehide event
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]pagehide\f[B]\f[R] event is sent to a \f[CR]Window\f[R]
when the browser hides the current page in the process of presenting a
different page from the session\(cqs history.
.PP
For example, when the user clicks the browser\(cqs Back button, the
current page receives a \f[CR]pagehide\f[R] event before the previous
page is shown.
.SH SYNTAX
Use the event name in methods like \f[CR]addEventListener()\f[R], or set
an event handler property.
.IP
.EX
addEventListener(\(dqpagehide\(dq, (event) => { })

onpagehide = (event) => { }
.EE
.SH EVENT TYPE
A \f[CR]PageTransitionEvent\f[R].
Inherits from \f[CR]Event\f[R].
.SH EVENT PROPERTIES
.TP
\f[B]PageTransitionEvent.persisted\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
Indicates if the document is loading from a cache.
.SH EVENT HANDLER ALIASES
In addition to the \f[CR]Window\f[R] interface, the event handler
property \f[CR]onpagehide\f[R] is also available on the following
targets:
.IP \(bu 2
\f[CR]HTMLBodyElement\f[R]
.IP \(bu 2
\f[CR]HTMLFrameSetElement\f[R]
.IP \(bu 2
\f[CR]SVGSVGElement\f[R]
.SH USAGE NOTES
Like the \f[CR]unload\f[R] and \f[CR]beforeunload\f[R] events, this
event is not reliably fired by browsers, especially on mobile.
For example, the \f[CR]pagehide\f[R] event is not fired at all in the
following scenario:
.IP "1." 3
A mobile user visits your page.
.IP "2." 3
The user then switches to a different app.
.IP "3." 3
Later, the user closes the browser from the app manager.
.PP
However, unlike the \f[CR]unload\f[R] and \f[CR]beforeunload\f[R]
events, this event is compatible with the \c
.UR https://web.dev/articles/bfcache
back/forward cache
.UE \c
\ (bfcache), so adding a listener to this event will not prevent the
page from being included in the bfcache.
.PP
The best event to use to signal the end of a user\(cqs session is the
\f[CR]visibilitychange\f[R] event.
In browsers that don\(cqt support \f[CR]visibilitychange\f[R] the
\f[CR]pagehide\f[R] event is the next\-best alternative.
.PP
If you\(cqre specifically trying to detect page unload events, the
\f[CR]pagehide\f[R] event is the best option.

.UR https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/page-lifecycle-api

.UE \c
\ guide for more information about how this event relates to other
events in the page lifecycle.
.SH EXAMPLES
In this example, an event handler is established to watch for
\f[CR]pagehide\f[R] events and to perform special handling if the page
is being persisted for possible reuse.
.IP
.EX
window.addEventListener(
  \(dqpagehide\(dq,
  (event) \f[B]=>\f[R] {
    \f[B]if\f[R] (event.persisted) {
      \f[I]/* the page isn\(aqt being discarded, so it can be reused later */\f[R]
    }
  },
  \f[B]false\f[R],
);
.EE
.PP
This can also be written using the \f[CR]onpagehide\f[R] event handler
property on the \f[CR]Window\f[R]:
.IP
.EX
window.onpagehide = (event) \f[B]=>\f[R] {
  \f[B]if\f[R] (event.persisted) {
    \f[I]/* the page isn\(aqt being discarded, so it can be reused later */\f[R]
  }
};
