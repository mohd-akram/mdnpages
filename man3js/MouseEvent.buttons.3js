.SH NAME
MouseEvent.buttons \- MouseEvent: buttons property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]MouseEvent.buttons\f[B]\f[R] read\-only property
indicates which buttons are pressed on the mouse (or other input device)
when a mouse event is triggered.
.PP
Each button that can be pressed is represented by a given number (see
below).
If more than one button is pressed, the button values are added together
to produce a new number.
For example, if the secondary (\f[CR]2\f[R]) and auxiliary
(\f[CR]4\f[R]) buttons are pressed simultaneously, the value is
\f[CR]6\f[R] (i.e., \f[CR]2 + 4\f[R]).
.RS
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R] Do not confuse this property with the
\f[CR]MouseEvent.button\f[R] property.
The \f[CR]MouseEvent.buttons\f[R] property indicates the state of
buttons pressed during any kind of mouse event, while the
\f[CR]MouseEvent.button\f[R] property only guarantees the correct value
for mouse events caused by pressing or releasing one or multiple
buttons.
.RE
.SH VALUE
A number representing one or more buttons.
For more than one button pressed simultaneously, the values are combined
(e.g., \f[CR]3\f[R] is primary + secondary).
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]0\f[R]: No button or un\-initialized

.SS Firefox notes
Firefox supports the \f[CR]buttons\f[R] attribute on Windows, Linux
(GTK), and macOS with the following restrictions:
.IP \[bu] 2
Utilities allow customization of button actions.
Therefore, \f[I]primary\f[R] might not be the left button on the device,
\f[I]secondary\f[R] might not be the right button, and so on.
Moreover, the middle (wheel) button, 4th button, and 5th button might
not be assigned a value, even when they are pressed.
.IP \[bu] 2
Single\-button devices may emulate additional buttons with combinations
of button and keyboard presses.
.IP \[bu] 2
Touch devices may emulate buttons with configurable gestures (e.g.,
one\-finger touch for \f[I]primary\f[R], two\-finger touch for
\f[I]secondary\f[R], etc.).
.IP \[bu] 2
On Linux (GTK), the 4th button and the 5th button are not supported.
In addition, a \f[CR]mouseup\f[R] event always includes the releasing
button information in the \f[CR]buttons\f[R] value.
.IP \[bu] 2
On Mac OS X 10.5, the \f[CR]buttons\f[R] attribute always returns
\f[CR]0\f[R] because there is no platform API for implementing this
feature.
