.SH NAME
URL.search \- URL: search property
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f[B]Note:\f[R] This feature is available in Web Workers.
.PP
The \f[B]\f[CB]search\f[B]\f[R] property of the \f[CR]URL\f[R] interface
is a search string, also called a \f[I]query string\f[R], that is a
string containing a \f[CR]\(dq?\(dq\f[R] followed by the parameters of
the URL.
If the URL does not have a search query, this property contains an empty
string, \f[CR]\(dq\(dq\f[R].
.PP
This property can be set to change the query string of the URL.
When setting, a single \f[CR]\(dq?\(dq\f[R] prefix is added to the
provided value, if not already present.
Setting it to \f[CR]\(dq\(dq\f[R] removes the query string.
.PP
The query is percent\-encoded when setting but not percent\-decoded when
reading.
.PP
Modern browsers provide the \f[CR]URL.searchParams\f[R] property to make
it easy to parse out the parameters from the query string.
.SH VALUE
A string.
.SH EXAMPLES
.SS Basic usage
.IP
.EX
\f[B]const\f[R] url = \f[B]new\f[R] URL(
  \(dqhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en\-US/docs/Web/API/URL/search?q=123\(dq,
);
console.log(url.search); \f[I]// Logs \(dq?q=123\(dq\f[R]
.EE
.SS Interaction with searchParams
The \f[CR]URL.searchParams\f[R] property exposes the \f[CR]search\f[R]
string as a \f[CR]URLSearchParams\f[R] object.
When updating this \f[CR]URLSearchParams\f[R], the URL\(cqs
\f[CR]search\f[R] is updated with its serialization.
However, \f[CR]URL.search\f[R] encodes a subset of characters that
\f[CR]URLSearchParams\f[R] does, and encodes spaces as \f[CR]%20\f[R]
instead of \f[CR]+\f[R].
This may cause some surprising interactions\(emif you update
\f[CR]searchParams\f[R], even with the same values, the URL may be
serialized differently.
.IP
.EX
\f[B]const\f[R] url = \f[B]new\f[R] URL(\(dqhttps://example.com/?a=b \(ti\(dq);
console.log(url.href); \f[I]// \(dqhttps://example.com/?a=b%20\(ti\(dq\f[R]
console.log(url.searchParams.toString()); \f[I]// \(dqa=b+%7E\(dq\f[R]
\f[I]// This should be a no\-op, but it changes the URL\(aqs query to the\f[R]
\f[I]// serialization of its searchParams\f[R]
url.searchParams.sort();
console.log(url.href); \f[I]// \(dqhttps://example.com/?a=b+%7E\(dq\f[R]

\f[B]const\f[R] url2 = \f[B]new\f[R] URL(\(dqhttps://example.com?search=1234&param=my%20param\(dq);
console.log(url2.search); \f[I]// \(dq?search=1234&param=my%20param\(dq\f[R]
url2.searchParams.delete(\(dqsearch\(dq);
console.log(url2.search); \f[I]// \(dq?param=my+param\(dq\f[R]
