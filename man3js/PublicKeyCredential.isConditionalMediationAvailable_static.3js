.SH NAME
PublicKeyCredential.isConditionalMediationAvailable_static \-
PublicKeyCredential: isConditionalMediationAvailable() static method
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f[B]Secure context:\f[R] This feature is available only in secure
contexts (HTTPS).
.PP
The \f[B]\f[CB]isConditionalMediationAvailable()\f[B]\f[R] static method
of the \f[CR]PublicKeyCredential\f[R] interface returns a
\f[CR]Promise\f[R] which resolves to \f[CR]true\f[R] if conditional
mediation is available.
.PP
Conditional mediation, if available, results in any discovered
credentials being presented to the user in a non\-modal dialog box along
with an indication of the origin requesting credentials.
This is requested by including
\f[CR]mediation: \[aq]conditional\[aq]\f[R] in your \f[CR]get()\f[R]
call.
In practice, this means autofilling available credentials; you need to
include \f[CR]autocomplete=\[dq]webauthn\[dq]\f[R] on your form fields
so that they will show the WebAuthn sign\-in options.
.PP
A conditional \f[CR]get()\f[R] call does not show the browser UI and
remains pending until the user picks an account to sign\-in with from
available autofill suggestions:
.IP \[bu] 2
If the user makes a gesture outside of the dialog, it closes without
resolving or rejecting the Promise and without causing a user\-visible
error condition.
.IP \[bu] 2
If the user selects a credential, that credential is returned to the
caller.
.PP
The prevent silent access flag (see
\f[CR]CredentialsContainer.preventSilentAccess()\f[R]) is treated as
being \f[CR]true\f[R] regardless of its actual value: the conditional
behavior always involves user mediation of some sort if applicable
credentials are discovered.
.RS
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R] If no credentials are discovered, the non\-modal dialog
will not be visible, and the user agent can prompt the user to take
action in a way that depends on the type of credential (for example, to
insert a device containing credentials).

.IP \[bu] 2
The browser supports the Web Authentication API.
.IP \[bu] 2
The browser supports WebAuthn conditional UI.
