.SH NAME
RTCRtpReceiver.getSynchronizationSources \- RTCRtpReceiver:
getSynchronizationSources() method
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]getSynchronizationSources()\f[B]\f[R] method of the
\f[CR]RTCRtpReceiver\f[R] interface returns an array of objects, each
corresponding to one SSRC (synchronization source) identifier received
by the current \f[CR]RTCRtpReceiver\f[R] in the last ten seconds.
.SH SYNTAX
.IP
.EX
getSynchronizationSources()
.EE
.SS Parameters
None.
.SS Return value
An array of objects, each describing one of the synchronization sources
that provided data to the incoming stream in the past ten seconds.
These objects contain the following properties:
.TP
\f[B]audioLevel\f[R]
A floating\-point value between 0.0 and 1.0 specifying the audio level
contained in the last RTP packet played from the synchronization source.
.RS
.PP
The value is on a linear scale and is defined in units of dBov, or
decibels (overload).
This is the amplitude relative to the point at which clipping of the
audio begins to occur.
A value of 1.0 represents 0 dBov (maximum volume), a value of 0.0
represents silence, and a value of 0.5 represents approximately 6 dB SPL
(decibels of sound pressure level) change in the sound pressure level
from 0 dBov.
.PP
This value is required and always present.
.RE
.TP
\f[B]rtpTimestamp\f[R] \f[I](optional)\f[R]
The RTP timestamp (an integer \f[CR]DOMHighResTimeStamp\f[R]) of the
media.
This source\-generated timestamp indicates the time at which the media
in this packet, scheduled for play out at the time indicated by
\f[CR]timestamp\f[R], was initially sampled or generated.
It may be useful for sequencing and synchronization purposes.
.TP
\f[B]source\f[R] \f[I](optional)\f[R]
A positive integer value specifying the SSRC identifier of the
synchronization source.
This uniquely identifies the source of the particular stream RTP
packets.
.TP
\f[B]timestamp\f[R] \f[I](optional)\f[R]
A \f[CR]DOMHighResTimeStamp\f[R] indicating the most recent time at
which a frame originating from this source was delivered to the
receiver\(cqs \f[CR]MediaStreamTrack\f[R]
