.SH NAME
Window.close \- Window: close() method
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]Window.close()\f[B]\f[R] method closes the current
window, or the window on which it was called.
.PP
This method can only be called on windows that were opened by a script
using the \f[CR]Window.open()\f[R] method, or on top\-level windows that
have a single history entry.
If the window doesn\[cq]t match these requirements, an error similar to
this one appears in the console:
\f[CR]Scripts may not close windows that were not opened by script.\f[R]
.PP
Note also that \f[CR]close()\f[R] has no effect when called on

\f[CR]HTMLIFrameElement.contentWindow\f[R].
