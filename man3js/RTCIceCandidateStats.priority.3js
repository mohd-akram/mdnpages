.SH NAME
RTCIceCandidateStats.priority \- RTCIceCandidateStats: priority property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]priority\f[B]\f[R] property of the
\f[CR]RTCIceCandidateStats\f[R] dictionary is a positive integer value
indicating the priority (or desirability) of the described candidate.
.SS Value
A positive integer indicating the priority of the
\f[CR]RTCIceCandidate\f[R] described by the
\f[CR]RTCIceCandidateStats\f[R] object.
The value may be anywhere from 1 to 2,147,483,647.
.SH DESCRIPTION
During ICE negotiation while setting up a WebRTC peer connection, the
priority values reported to the remote peer by a user agent are used to
determine which candidates are considered \(lqmore desirable\(rq.
The higher the value, the more desirable the candidate is.
.SS Determining priority
The ICE specification describes how user agents and other software using
WebRTC should calculate the priority.
The priority of a candidate is calculated using the following variables
as inputs:
.IP \(bu 2
The preferability of the candidate type (local, server reflexive, peer
reflexive, or relayed)
.IP \(bu 2
The preferability of the candidate\(cqs specific IP address (for
multihomed agents)
.IP \(bu 2
The candidate\(cqs component ID (1 for RTP, 2 for RTCP)
.PP
The candidate\(cqs priority is computed using the formula
(\f[I]p_type\f[R] is the priority of the candidate\(cqs type and
\f[I]p_local\f[R] is the priority of the IP address):
.PP
\ priority=224×ptype+28×plocal+(256\-componentID) = 2\(ha{24} p_{type} +
2\(ha{8} p_{local} + (.
256 \-  .) 
.PP
This is equivalent to mapping the priorities of the candidate type, the
local IP, and the component ID into various bit ranges within the
32\-bit \f[CR]priority\f[R] value.
