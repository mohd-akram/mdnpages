.SH NAME
AuthenticatorAttestationResponse.getTransports \-
AuthenticatorAttestationResponse: getTransports() method
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f[B]Secure context:\f[R] This feature is available only in secure
contexts (HTTPS).
.PP
The \f[B]\f[CB]getTransports()\f[B]\f[R] method of the
\f[CR]AuthenticatorAttestationResponse\f[R] interface returns an array
of strings describing the different transports which may be used by the
authenticator.
.PP
Such transports may be USB, NFC, BLE, internal (applicable when the
authenticator is not removable from the device), or a hybrid approach.
Sites should not interpret this array but instead store it along with
the rest of the credential information.
In a subsequent \f[CR]navigator.credentials.get()\f[R] call, the
\f[CR]transports\f[R] value(s) specified inside
\f[CR]publicKey.allowCredentials\f[R] should be set to the stored array
value.
This provides a hint to the browser as to which types of authenticators
to try when making an assertion for this credential.
