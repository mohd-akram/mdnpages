Window.originAgentCluster \- Window: originAgentCluster property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]originAgentCluster\f[B]\f[R] read\-only property of the
\f[CR]Window\f[R] interface returns \f[CR]true\f[R] if this window
belongs to an \f[I]origin\-keyed \c
.UR https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-agent-clusters
agent cluster
.UE \c
\f[R]: this means that the operating system has provided dedicated
resources (for example an operating system process) to this window\(cqs
origin that are not shared with windows from other origins.
.PP
Otherwise this property returns \f[CR]false\f[R].
.PP
Windows that are part of an origin\-keyed agent cluster are subjects to
some additional restrictions, compared with windows that are not.
In particular, they cannot:
.IP \(bu 2
Set \f[CR]Document.domain\f[R], which is a legacy feature that normally
allows same\-site cross\-origin pages to synchronously access each
other\(cqs DOM.
.IP \(bu 2
Send \f[CR]WebAssembly.Module\f[R] objects to other same\-site
cross\-origin pages via \f[CR]Window.postMessage()\f[R].
.IP \(bu 2
Send \f[CR]SharedArrayBuffer\f[R] or \f[CR]WebAssembly.Memory\f[R]
objects to other same\-site cross\-origin pages.
.PP
To request that the browser assign this window to an origin\-keyed agent
cluster, the server must send the \f[CR]Origin\-Agent\-Cluster\f[R]
response header.
.PP
Note that the origin\-keyed agent cluster feature is only supported in
secure contexts.
If a site is not a secure context, the
\f[CR]window.originAgentCluster\f[R] will always return
\f[CR]false\f[R].
