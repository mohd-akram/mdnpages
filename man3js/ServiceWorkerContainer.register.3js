.SH NAME
ServiceWorkerContainer.register \- ServiceWorkerContainer: register()
method
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f[B]Secure context\f[R]: This feature is available only in secure
contexts (HTTPS).
.PP
The \f[B]\f[CB]register()\f[B]\f[R] method of the
\f[CR]ServiceWorkerContainer\f[R] interface creates or updates a
\f[CR]ServiceWorkerRegistration\f[R] for the given \f[CR]scriptURL\f[R].
.PP
If successful, a service worker registration ties the provided script
URL to a \f[I]scope\f[R], which is subsequently used for navigation
matching.
You can call this method unconditionally from the controlled page.
I.e., you don\[cq]t need to first check whether there\[cq]s an active
registration.
.PP
There is frequent confusion surrounding the meaning and use of
\f[I]scope\f[R].
Since a service worker can\[cq]t have a scope broader than its own
location, only use the \f[CR]scope\f[R] option when you need a scope
that is narrower than the default.

.SS Parameters
.TP
\f[B]scriptURL\f[R]
The URL of the service worker script.
The registered service worker file needs to have a valid JavaScript MIME
type.
.TP
\f[B]options\f[R] \f[I](optional)\f[R]
An object containing registration options.
Currently available options are:
.RS
.TP
\f[B]scope\f[R]
A string representing a URL that defines a service worker\[cq]s
registration scope; that is, what range of URLs a service worker can
control.
This is usually a relative URL.
It is relative to the base URL of the application.
By default, the \f[CR]scope\f[R] value for a service worker registration
is set to the directory where the service worker script is located.
See the Examples section for more information on how it works.
.TP
\f[B]type\f[R]
A string specifying the type of worker to create.
Valid values are:
.RS
.TP
\f[B]\[aq]classic\[aq]\f[R]
The loaded service worker is in a standard script.
This is the default.
.TP
\f[B]\[aq]module\[aq]\f[R]
The loaded service worker is in an ES module and the import statement is
available on worker contexts.
For ES module compatibility info, see the browser compatibility data
table for the \f[CR]ServiceWorker\f[R] interface.
.RE
.TP
\f[B]updateViaCache\f[R]
A string indicating how the HTTP cache is used for service worker
scripts resources during updates.
Note: This only refers to the service worker script and its imports, not
other resources fetched by these scripts.
.RS
.TP
\f[B]\[aq]all\[aq]\f[R]
The HTTP cache will be queried for the main script, and all imported
scripts.
If no fresh entry is found in the HTTP cache, then the scripts are
fetched from the network.
.TP
\f[B]\[aq]imports\[aq]\f[R]
The HTTP cache will be queried for imports, but the main script will
always be updated from the network.
If no fresh entry is found in the HTTP cache for the imports,
they\[cq]re fetched from the network.
.TP
\f[B]\[aq]none\[aq]\f[R]
The HTTP cache will not be used for the main script or its imports.
All service worker script resources will be updated from the network.
.RE
.RE
.SS Return value
A \f[CR]Promise\f[R] that resolves with a
\f[CR]ServiceWorkerRegistration\f[R] object.
.SH EXAMPLES
The examples described here should be taken together to get a better
understanding of how service workers scope applies to a page.
.PP
The following example uses the default value of \f[CR]scope\f[R] (by
omitting it).
The service worker code in this case, if included in
\f[CR]example.com/index.html\f[R], will control
\f[CR]example.com/index.html\f[R], as well as pages underneath it, like
\f[CR]example.com/product/description.html\f[R].

.EX
\f[B]if\f[R] (\[dq]serviceWorker\[dq] \f[B]in\f[R] navigator) {

  \f[I]// site using the default scope.\f[R]
  navigator.serviceWorker.register(\[dq]/sw.js\[dq]).then(
    (registration) \f[B]=>\f[R] {

    },
  );

  console.error(\[dq]Service workers are not supported.\[dq]);
}
.EE
.PP
The following code, if included in \f[CR]example.com/index.html\f[R], at
the root of a site, would apply to exactly the same pages as the example
above.
Remember the scope, when included, uses the page\[cq]s location as its
base.
.PP
Alternatively, if this code were included in a page at
\f[CR]example.com/product/description.html\f[R], with the JavaScript
file residing at \f[CR]example.com/product/sw.js\f[R], then the service
worker would only apply to resources under
\f[CR]example.com/product\f[R].

Since a service worker can\[cq]t have a scope broader than its own
location, only use the \f[CR]scope\f[R] option when you need a scope
that is narrower than the default.

The following code, if included in \f[CR]example.com/index.html\f[R], at
the root of a site, would only apply to resources under
\f[CR]example.com/product\f[R].

.EE
.PP
However, servers can remove this restriction by setting a \c
.UR https://w3c.github.io/ServiceWorker/#service-worker-allowed
Service\-Worker\-Allowed
.UE \c
\ header on the service worker script, and then you can specify a max
scope for that service worker above the service worker\[cq]s location.
