.SH NAME
RTCRtpTransceiver.stop \- RTCRtpTransceiver: stop() method
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]stop()\f[B]\f[R] method in the
\f[CR]RTCRtpTransceiver\f[R] interface permanently stops the transceiver
by stopping both the associated \f[CR]RTCRtpSender\f[R] and
\f[CR]RTCRtpReceiver\f[R].
.SH SYNTAX
.IP
.EX
stop()
.EE
.SS Parameters
None.
.SS Return value
None (\f[CR]undefined\f[R]).
.SS Exceptions
.TP
\f[B]InvalidStateError\f[R] \f[B]DOMException\f[R]
Thrown if the \f[CR]RTCPeerConnection\f[R], of which the transceiver is
a member, is closed.
.SH DESCRIPTION
When you call \f[CR]stop()\f[R] on a transceiver, the sender immediately
stops sending media and each of its RTP streams are closed using the
RTCP \f[CR]\[dq]BYE\[dq]\f[R] message.
The receiver then stops receiving media; the receiver\[cq]s
\f[CR]track\f[R] is stopped, and the transceiver\[cq]s
\f[CR]direction\f[R] is changed to \f[CR]stopped\f[R].
Renegotiation is triggered by sending a \f[CR]negotiationneeded\f[R]
event to the transceiver\[cq]s \f[CR]RTCPeerConnection\f[R], so that the
connection can adapt to the change.
.PP
The method does nothing if the transceiver is already stopped.
You can check whether it has stopped by comparing
\f[CR]currentDirection\f[R] to \f[CR]\[dq]stopped\[dq]\f[R].
.RS
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R] Earlier versions of the specification used the
deprecated \f[CR]stopped\f[R] \f[I](deprecated)\f[R] property to
indicate if the transceiver has stopped.
