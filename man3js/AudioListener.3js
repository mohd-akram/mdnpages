.SH NAME
AudioListener \- AudioListener
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[CR]AudioListener\f[R] interface represents the position and
orientation of the unique person listening to the audio scene, and is
used in audio spatialization.
All \f[CR]PannerNode\f[R]s spatialize in relation to the
\f[CR]AudioListener\f[R] stored in the
\f[CR]BaseAudioContext.listener\f[R] attribute.
.PP
It is important to note that there is only one listener per context and
that it isn\[cq]t an \f[CR]AudioNode\f[R].
[IMAGE: We see the position, up and front vectors of an AudioListener,

.SH INSTANCE PROPERTIES
.RS
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R] The position, forward, and up value are set and
retrieved using different syntaxes.
Retrieval is done by accessing, for example,
\f[CR]AudioListener.positionX\f[R], while setting the same property is
done with \f[CR]AudioListener.positionX.value\f[R].
This is why these values are not marked read only, which is how they
appear in the specification\[cq]s IDL.
.RE
.TP
\f[B]AudioListener.positionX\f[R]
Represents the horizontal position of the listener in a right\-hand
cartesian coordinate system.
The default is 0.
.TP
\f[B]AudioListener.positionY\f[R]
Represents the vertical position of the listener in a right\-hand
cartesian coordinate system.
The default is 0.
.TP
\f[B]AudioListener.positionZ\f[R]
Represents the longitudinal (back and forth) position of the listener in
a right\-hand cartesian coordinate system.
The default is 0.
.TP
\f[B]AudioListener.forwardX\f[R]
Represents the horizontal position of the listener\[cq]s forward
direction in the same cartesian coordinate system as the position
(\f[CR]positionX\f[R], \f[CR]positionY\f[R], and \f[CR]positionZ\f[R])
values.
The forward and up values are linearly independent of each other.
The default is 0.
.TP
\f[B]AudioListener.forwardY\f[R]
Represents the vertical position of the listener\[cq]s forward direction
in the same cartesian coordinate system as the position
(\f[CR]positionX\f[R], \f[CR]positionY\f[R], and \f[CR]positionZ\f[R])
values.
The forward and up values are linearly independent of each other.
The default is 0.
.TP
\f[B]AudioListener.forwardZ\f[R]
Represents the longitudinal (back and forth) position of the
listener\[cq]s forward direction in the same cartesian coordinate system
as the position (\f[CR]positionX\f[R], \f[CR]positionY\f[R], and
\f[CR]positionZ\f[R]) values.
The forward and up values are linearly independent of each other.
The default is \-1.
.TP
\f[B]AudioListener.upX\f[R]
Represents the horizontal position of the top of the listener\[cq]s head
in the same cartesian coordinate system as the position
(\f[CR]positionX\f[R], \f[CR]positionY\f[R], and \f[CR]positionZ\f[R])
values.
The forward and up values are linearly independent of each other.
The default is 0.
.TP
\f[B]AudioListener.upY\f[R]
Represents the vertical position of the top of the listener\[cq]s head
in the same cartesian coordinate system as the position
(\f[CR]positionX\f[R], \f[CR]positionY\f[R], and \f[CR]positionZ\f[R])
values.
The forward and up values are linearly independent of each other.
The default is 1.
.TP
\f[B]AudioListener.upZ\f[R]
Represents the longitudinal (back and forth) position of the top of the
listener\[cq]s head in the same cartesian coordinate system as the
position (\f[CR]positionX\f[R], \f[CR]positionY\f[R], and
\f[CR]positionZ\f[R]) values.
The forward and up values are linearly independent of each other.
The default is 0.
.SH INSTANCE METHODS
.TP
\f[B]AudioListener.setOrientation()\f[R] \f[I](deprecated)\f[R]
Sets the orientation of the listener.
.TP
\f[B]AudioListener.setPosition()\f[R] \f[I](deprecated)\f[R]
Sets the position of the listener.
.RS
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R] Although these methods are deprecated they are currently
the only way to set the orientation and position in Firefox (see \c
.UR https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1283029
Firefox bug 1283029
.UE \c
).
.RE
.SH DEPRECATED FEATURES
The \f[CR]setOrientation()\f[R] and \f[CR]setPosition()\f[R] methods
have been replaced by setting their property value equivalents.
For example \f[CR]setPosition(x, y, z)\f[R] can be achieved by setting
\f[CR]positionX.value\f[R], \f[CR]positionY.value\f[R], and
\f[CR]positionZ.value\f[R] respectively.
.SH EXAMPLE
See \f[CR]BaseAudioContext.createPanner()\f[R] for example code.
