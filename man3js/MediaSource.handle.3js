.SH NAME
MediaSource.handle \- MediaSource: handle property
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f[B]Note:\f[R] This feature is only available in Dedicated Web Workers.
.PP
The \f[B]\f[CB]handle\f[B]\f[R] read\-only property of the
\f[CR]MediaSource\f[R] interface returns a \f[CR]MediaSourceHandle\f[R]
object, a proxy for the \f[CR]MediaSource\f[R] that can be transferred
from a dedicated worker back to the main thread and attached to a media
element via its \f[CR]HTMLMediaElement.srcObject\f[R] property.
.RS
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R] \f[CR]handle\f[R] is only visible on
\f[CR]MediaSource\f[R] instances inside dedicated workers.
.RE
.PP
Each \f[CR]MediaSource\f[R] object created inside a dedicated worker has
its own distinct \f[CR]MediaSourceHandle\f[R].
The \f[CR]handle\f[R] getter will always return the
\f[CR]MediaSourceHandle\f[R] instance specific to the associated
dedicated worker \f[CR]MediaSource\f[R] instance.
If the handle has already been transferred to the main thread using
\f[CR]postMessage()\f[R], the handle instance in the worker is
technically detached and can\(cqt be transferred again.
.SH VALUE
A \f[CR]MediaSourceHandle\f[R] object instance.
.SH EXAMPLES
The \f[CR]handle\f[R] property can be accessed inside a dedicated worker
and the resulting \f[CR]MediaSourceHandle\f[R] object is then
transferred over to the thread that created the worker (in this case the
main thread) via a \f[CR]postMessage()\f[R] call:
.IP
.EX
\f[I]// Inside dedicated worker\f[R]
\f[B]let\f[R] mediaSource = \f[B]new\f[R] MediaSource();
\f[B]let\f[R] handle = mediaSource.handle;
\f[I]// Transfer the handle to the context that created the worker\f[R]
postMessage({ arg: handle }, [handle]);

mediaSource.addEventListener(\(dqsourceopen\(dq, () \f[B]=>\f[R] {
  \f[I]// Await sourceopen on MediaSource before creating SourceBuffers\f[R]
  \f[I]// and populating them with fetched media \(em MediaSource won\(aqt\f[R]
  \f[I]// accept creation of SourceBuffers until it is attached to the\f[R]
  \f[I]// HTMLMediaElement and its readyState is \(dqopen\(dq\f[R]
});
.EE
.PP
Over in the main thread, we receive the handle via a \f[CR]message\f[R]
event handler, attach it to a \f[CR]<video>\f[R] via its
\f[CR]HTMLMediaElement.srcObject\f[R] property, and \f[CR]play\f[R] the
video:
.IP
.EX
worker.addEventListener(\(dqmessage\(dq, (msg) \f[B]=>\f[R] {
  \f[B]let\f[R] mediaSourceHandle = msg.data.arg;
  video.srcObject = mediaSourceHandle;
  video.play();
});
.EE
.RS
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R] \f[CR]MediaSourceHandle\f[R]s cannot be successfully
transferred into or via a shared worker or service worker.
