.SH NAME
Range.cloneContents \- Range: cloneContents() method
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]cloneContents()\f[B]\f[R] method of the \f[CR]Range\f[R]
interface copies the selected \f[CR]Node\f[R] children of the range\(cqs
\f[CR]commonAncestorContainer\f[R] and puts them in a new
\f[CR]DocumentFragment\f[R] object.
.PP
Nodes are cloned using the same algorithm as
\f[CR]Node.cloneNode()\f[R], which means event listeners attached with
scripts are not cloned.
HTML \f[CR]id\f[R] attributes are cloned, which can lead to an invalid
document through cloning.
.PP
The first and last selected children of
\f[CR]commonAncestorContainer\f[R] may be partially selected.
In this case, the child node itself is cloned, but its content is only
the part that is selected, by recursively cloning the range between the
original range\(cqs start/end boundary and that child node\(cqs
end/start boundary.
