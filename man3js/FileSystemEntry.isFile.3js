.SH NAME
FileSystemEntry.isFile \- FileSystemEntry: isFile property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The read\-only \f[B]\f[CB]isFile\f[B]\f[R] property of the
\f[CR]FileSystemEntry\f[R] interface is \f[CR]true\f[R] if the entry
represents a file (meaning it\[cq]s a \f[CR]FileSystemFileEntry\f[R])
and \f[CR]false\f[R] if it\[cq]s not.
.PP
You can also use \f[CR]isDirectory\f[R] to determine if the entry is a
directory.
.RS
.PP
\f[B]Warning:\f[R] You should not assume that any entry which isn\[cq]t
a file is a directory or vice versa.
There are other types of file descriptors on many operating systems.
Be sure to use both \f[CR]isDirectory\f[R] and \f[CR]isFile\f[R] as
needed to ensure that the entry is something you know how to work with.
.RE
.SH VALUE
A Boolean indicating whether or not the \f[CR]FileSystemEntry\f[R] is a

.SH EXAMPLES

to process the entry as a directory or file.

message.
