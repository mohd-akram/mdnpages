.SH NAME
Blob.text \- Blob: text() method
.SH SYNOPSIS
This feature is available in Web Workers.
.PP
The \f[B]\f[CB]text()\f[B]\f[R] method of the \f[CR]Blob\f[R] interface
returns a \f[CR]Promise\f[R] that resolves with a string containing the
contents of the blob, interpreted as UTF\-8.
.SH SYNTAX
.IP
.EX
text()
.EE
.SS Parameters
None.
.SS Return value
A promise that resolves with a string which contains the blob\[cq]s data
as a text string.
The data is \f[I]always\f[R] presumed to be in UTF\-8 format.
.SH USAGE NOTES
The \f[CR]FileReader\f[R] method \f[CR]readAsText()\f[R] is an older
method that performs a similar function.
It works on both \f[CR]Blob\f[R] and \f[CR]File\f[R] objects.
There are two key differences:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]Blob.text()\f[R] returns a promise, whereas
\f[CR]FileReader.readAsText()\f[R] is an event based API.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]Blob.text()\f[R] always uses UTF\-8 as encoding, while
\f[CR]FileReader.readAsText()\f[R] can use a different encoding
depending on the blob\[cq]s type and a specified encoding name.
