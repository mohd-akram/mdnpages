.SH NAME
CSSRuleList \- CSSRuleList
.SH SYNOPSIS
A \f[CR]CSSRuleList\f[R] represents an ordered collection of read\-only
\f[CR]CSSRule\f[R] objects.
.PP
While the \f[CR]CSSRuleList\f[R] object is read\-only, and cannot be
directly modified, it is considered a \f[CR]live\f[R] object, as the
content can change over time.
.PP
To edit the underlying rules returned by \f[CR]CSSRule\f[R] objects, use
\f[CR]CSSStyleSheet.insertRule()\f[R] and
\f[CR]CSSStyleSheet.deleteRule()\f[R], which are methods of
\f[CR]CSSStyleSheet\f[R].
.PP
The interface has no constructor.
An instance of \f[CR]CSSRuleList\f[R] is returned by
\f[CR]CSSStyleSheet.cssRules\f[R] and
\f[CR]CSSKeyframesRule.cssRules\f[R].

already using it.
Modern APIs use types that wrap around ECMAScript array types instead,
so you can treat them like ECMAScript arrays, and at the same time
impose additional semantics on their usage (such as making their items
read\-only).

.SH INSTANCE PROPERTIES
.TP
\f[B]CSSRuleList.length\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
Returns an integer representing the number of \f[CR]CSSRule\f[R] objects
in the collection.
.SH INSTANCE METHODS
.TP
\f[B]CSSRuleList.item()\f[R]
Gets a single \f[CR]CSSRule\f[R].
.SH EXAMPLES
In the following example there is a stylesheet with three rules.
Using \f[CR]CSSStyleSheet.cssRules\f[R] returns a
\f[CR]CSSRuleList\f[R], which is printed to the console.
.PP
The number of rules in the list is printed to the console using
\f[CR]CSSRuleList.length\f[R].
The first \f[CR]CSSRule\f[R] can be returned by using \f[CR]0\f[R] as
the parameter for \f[CR]CSSRuleList.item\f[R], in the example this will
return the rules set for the \f[CR]body\f[R] selector.
