.SH NAME
WorkerNavigator.userAgent \- WorkerNavigator: userAgent property
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f[B]Note:\f[R] This feature is only available in Web Workers.
.PP
The \f[B]\f[CB]WorkerNavigator.userAgent\f[B]\f[R] read\-only property
returns the user agent string for the current browser.
.RS
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R] The specification asks browsers to provide as little
information via this field as possible.
Never assume that the value of this property will stay the same in
future versions of the same browser.
Try not to use it at all, or only for current and past versions of a
browser.
New browsers may start using the same UA, or part of it, as an older
browser: you really have no guarantee that the browser agent is indeed
the one advertised by this property.
.PP
Also keep in mind that users of a browser can change the value of this
field if they want (UA spoofing).
.RE
.PP
Browser identification based on detecting the user agent string is
\f[B]unreliable\f[R] and \f[B]is not recommended\f[R], as the user agent
string is user configurable.
For example:
.IP \[bu] 2
In Firefox, you can change the preference
\f[CR]general.useragent.override\f[R] in \f[CR]about:config\f[R].
Some Firefox extensions do that; however, this only changes the HTTP
header that gets sent, and doesn\[cq]t affect browser detection
performed by JavaScript code.
.IP \[bu] 2
Opera 6+ allows users to set the browser identification string via a
menu.
.SH VALUE
A string specifying the complete user agent string the browser provides
both in HTTP headers and in response to this and other related methods
on the \f[CR]WorkerNavigator\f[R] object.
.PP
The user agent string is built on a formal structure which can be
decomposed into several pieces of info.
Each of these pieces of info comes from other navigator properties which
are also settable by the user.
Gecko\-based browsers comply with the following general structure:
.IP
.EX
userAgent = appCodeName/appVersion number (Platform; Security; OS\-or\-CPU;
Localization; rv: revision\-version\-number) product/productSub
Application\-Name Application\-Name\-version
.EE
.SH EXAMPLES
.IP
.EX
alert(navigator.userAgent);
\f[I]// alerts \[dq]Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; en\-US; rv:0.9.2) Gecko/20010725 Netscape6/6.1\[dq]\f[R]
.EE
