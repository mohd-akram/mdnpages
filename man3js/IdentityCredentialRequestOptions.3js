The browser uses this value to vary the text in its FedCM UI to better
suit the context.
Possible values are:
.RS
.TP
\f[B]\[dq]continue\[dq]\f[R]
Suitable for situations where the user is choosing an identity to
continue to the next page in the flow, which requires a sign\-in.
Browsers will provide a text string similar to:
.RS

\f[B]providers\f[R]
An array containing a single object specifying details of an IdP to be
used to sign in.
This object can contain the following properties:
.RS
.TP
\f[B]configURL\f[R]
A string specifying the URL of the IdP\[cq]s config file.
See Provide a config file for more information.
.TP
\f[B]clientId\f[R]
A string specifying the RP\[cq]s client identifier.
This information is issued by the IdP to the RP in a separate process
that is specific to the IdP.
.TP
\f[B]loginHint\f[R] \f[I](optional)\f[R]
A string providing a hint about the account option(s) the browser should
provide for the user to sign in with.
This is useful in cases where the user has already signed in and the
site asks them to reauthenticate.
Otherwise, the reauthentication process can be confusing when a user has
multiple accounts and can\[cq]t remember which one they used to sign in
previously.
The value for the \f[CR]loginHint\f[R] property can be taken from the
user\[cq]s previous sign\-in, and is matched against the
\f[CR]login_hints\f[R] values provided by the IdP in the array of user
information returned from the IdP\[cq]s accounts list endpoint.
.TP
\f[B]nonce\f[R] \f[I](optional)\f[R]
A random string that can be included to ensure the response is issued
specifically for this request and prevent replay attacks.
.RS
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R] Currently FedCM only allows the API to be invoked with a
single IdP, i.e.\ the \f[CR]providers\f[R] array has to have a length of
1.
Multiple IdPs must be supported via different \f[CR]get()\f[R] calls.
