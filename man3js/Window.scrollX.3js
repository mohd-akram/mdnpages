.SH NAME
Window.scrollX \- Window: scrollX property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The read\-only \f[B]\f[CB]scrollX\f[B]\f[R] property of the
\f[CR]Window\f[R] interface returns the number of pixels that the
document is currently scrolled horizontally.
This value is subpixel precise in modern browsers, meaning that it
isn\[cq]t necessarily a whole number.
You can get the number of pixels the document is scrolled vertically
from the \f[CR]scrollY\f[R] property.
.SH VALUE
In practice, the returned value is a double\-precision floating\-point
value with the range of E(min)=\-1022 to E(max)=1023 indicating the
number of pixels the document is currently scrolled horizontally from
the origin, where a positive value means the content is scrolled to the
left.
If the document is rendered on a subpixel\-precise device, then the
returned value is also subpixel\-precise and may contain a decimal
component.
If the document isn\[cq]t scrolled at all left or right, then
\f[CR]scrollX\f[R] is 0.
.RS

\f[B]Note:\f[R] If you need an integer value, you can use
\f[CR]Math.round()\f[R] to round it off.
.RE
.PP
In more technical terms, \f[CR]scrollX\f[R] returns the X coordinate of
the left edge of the current viewport.
If there is no viewport, the returned value is 0.
.SH EXAMPLES
This example checks the current horizontal scroll position of the
document.
If it\[cq]s greater than 400 pixels, the window is scrolled back to the
beginning.
