.SH NAME
Window.scrollX \- Window: scrollX property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The read\-only \f[B]\f[CB]scrollX\f[B]\f[R] property of the
\f[CR]Window\f[R] interface returns the number of pixels by which the
document is currently scrolled horizontally.
This value is subpixel precise in modern browsers, meaning that it
isn\(cqt necessarily a whole number.
You can get the number of pixels the document is scrolled vertically
from the \f[CR]scrollY\f[R] property.
.SH VALUE
A double\-precision floating\-point value indicating the number of
pixels by which the document is currently scrolled horizontally from the
origin, where a positive value means the content is scrolled to the
right (to reveal more content to the right).
In more technical terms, \f[CR]scrollX\f[R] returns the X coordinate of
the left edge of the current viewport.
If the document isn\(cqt scrolled at all left or right, then
\f[CR]scrollX\f[R] is 0.
If there is no viewport, the returned value is 0.
If the document is rendered on a subpixel\-precise device, then the
returned value is also subpixel\-precise and may contain a decimal
component.
.RS
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R] If you need an integer value, you can use
\f[CR]Math.round()\f[R] to round it off.
.RE
.PP
It\(cqs possible for \f[CR]scrollX\f[R] to be negative if the document
can be scrolled to the left from the initial containing block.
For example, if the document is right\-to\-left and content grows to the
left.
.PP
Safari responds to overscrolling by updating \f[CR]scrollX\f[R] beyond
the maximum scroll position (unless the default \(lqbounce\(rq effect is
disabled, such as by setting \f[CR]overscroll\-behavior\f[R] to
\f[CR]none\f[R]), while Chrome and Firefox do not.
.PP
This property is read\-only.
To scroll the window to a particular place, use
\f[CR]Window.scroll()\f[R].
.SH EXAMPLES
This example checks the current horizontal scroll position of the
document.
If it\(cqs greater than 400 pixels, the window is scrolled back to the
beginning.

.EX
\f[B]if\f[R] (window.scrollX > 400) {
  window.scroll(0, 0);
}
.EE
.SH NOTES
The \f[CR]pageXOffset\f[R] property is an alias for the
\f[CR]scrollX\f[R] property.
This means if you haven\(cqt re\-assigned either property,
\f[CR]window.pageXOffset === window.scrollX\f[R] is always true.
