.SH NAME
ReadableStreamDefaultReader.cancel \- ReadableStreamDefaultReader:
cancel() method
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f[B]Note:\f[R] This feature is available in Web Workers.
.PP
The \f[B]\f[CB]cancel()\f[B]\f[R] method of the
\f[CR]ReadableStreamDefaultReader\f[R] interface returns a
\f[CR]Promise\f[R] that resolves when the stream is canceled.
Calling this method signals a loss of interest in the stream by a
consumer.
.PP
Cancel is used when you\[cq]ve completely finished with the stream and
don\[cq]t need any more data from it, even if there are chunks enqueued
waiting to be read.
That data is lost after cancel is called, and the stream is not readable
any more.
To read those chunks still and not completely get rid of the stream,
you\[cq]d use \f[CR]ReadableStreamDefaultController.close()\f[R].
.RS
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R] If the reader is active, the \f[CR]cancel()\f[R] method
behaves the same as that for the associated stream
(\f[CR]ReadableStream.cancel()\f[R]).

.SS Parameters
.TP
\f[B]reason\f[R] \f[I](optional)\f[R]
A human\-readable reason for the cancellation.
This value may or may not be used.
.SS Return value
A \f[CR]Promise\f[R], which fulfills with the value given in the
\f[CR]reason\f[R] parameter.
.SS Exceptions
.TP
\f[B]TypeError\f[R]
The source object is not a \f[CR]ReadableStreamDefaultReader\f[R], or
the stream has no owner.
.SH EXAMPLES
In the following simple example, a previously\-created custom
\f[CR]ReadableStream\f[R] is read using a
\f[CR]ReadableStreamDefaultReader\f[R] created using
\f[CR]getReader()\f[R].
(this code is based on our \c
.UR https://mdn.github.io/dom-examples/streams/simple-random-stream/
Simple random stream example
.UE \c
).
Each chunk is read sequentially and output to the UI, until the stream
has finished being read, at which point we return out of the recursive
function and print the entire stream to another part of the UI.
.PP
When the stream is done (\f[CR]if (done)\f[R]), we run
\f[CR]reader.cancel()\f[R] to cancel the stream, signalling that we
don\[cq]t need to use it any more.
