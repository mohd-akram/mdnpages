.SH NAME
WakeLockSentinel.released \- WakeLockSentinel: released property
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f[B]Secure context:\f[R] This feature is available only in secure
contexts (HTTPS).
.PP
The \f[B]\f[CB]released\f[B]\f[R] read\-only property of the
\f[CR]WakeLockSentinel\f[R] interface returns a boolean that indicates
whether a \f[CR]WakeLockSentinel\f[R] has been released.
.PP
The \f[CR]WakeLockSentinel\f[R] is released when the associated platform
screen wake lock is revoked; afterwards \f[CR]released\f[R] will always
return \f[CR]true\f[R].
If a subsequent screen wake lock is required, the application will need
to request a new screen wake lock (the current
\f[CR]WakeLockSentinel\f[R] cannot be reused).
.SH VALUE
A boolean value that is \f[CR]false\f[R] until the
\f[CR]WakeLockSentinel\f[R] has been released (either through a call to
\f[CR]WakeLockSentinel.release()\f[R] or because the lock has been
released automatically) and the \f[CR]release\f[R] event has been
emitted, after which it becomes \f[CR]true\f[R] and no longer changes.
.SH EXAMPLES
This example shows how the value of the \f[CR]released\f[R] property
changes within a \f[CR]WakeLockSentinel\f[R]\[cq]s life cycle.
