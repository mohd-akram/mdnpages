.SH NAME
ShadowRoot.delegatesFocus \- ShadowRoot: delegatesFocus property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]delegatesFocus\f[B]\f[R] read\-only property of the
\f[CR]ShadowRoot\f[R] interface returns \f[CR]true\f[R] if the shadow
root delegates focus, and \f[CR]false\f[R] otherwise.
.PP
If \f[CR]true\f[R], when a non\-focusable part of the shadow DOM is
clicked, or \f[CR].focus()\f[R] is called on the host element, the first
focusable part inside the host\[cq]s shadow DOM is given focus, and the
shadow host is given any available \f[CR]:focus\f[R] styling.
.PP
Focus is of particular importance for keyboard users (including those
using screen readers).
\f[CR]delegatesFocus\f[R] default behavior is to focus the first
focusable element \[em] which may be undesirable if that element is not
meant to be part of the tabbing order (for example, an element with
\f[CR]tabindex=\[dq]\-1\[dq]\f[R]), or if a more `important' focusable
element should receive initial focus (for instance, the first text field
rather than the `close' button which precedes it).
In such cases, the \f[CR]autofocus\f[R] attribute can be specified on
the element which should receive initial focus.
Use the \f[CR]autofocus\f[R] attribute with caution as it can introduce
accessibility issues, such as bypassing important content which may go
unnoticed due to focus being set to an element later in the DOM order.
.PP
The property value is originally set using the \f[CR]delegatesFocus\f[R]
property of the object passed to \f[CR]Element.attachShadow()\f[R], or
using the \f[CR]shadowrootdelegatesfocus\f[R] attribute of the
\f[CR]<template>\f[R] element when a shadow root is created
declaratively.
.SH VALUE
\f[CR]true\f[R] if the shadow root delegates focus, and \f[CR]false\f[R]
otherwise.
.SH EXAMPLES
.IP
.EX
\f[B]let\f[R] customElem = document.querySelector(\[dq]my\-shadow\-dom\-element\[dq]);
\f[B]let\f[R] shadow = customElem.shadowRoot;

\f[I]// ...\f[R]

\f[I]// Does it delegate focus?\f[R]
\f[B]let\f[R] hostElem = shadow.delegatesFocus;
.EE
.PP
The Declarative Shadow DOM with delegated focus example in the
\f[CR]<template>\f[R] documentation demonstrates the effects of
delegating focus.
