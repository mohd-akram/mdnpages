.SH NAME
DynamicsCompressorNode.threshold \- DynamicsCompressorNode: threshold
property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[CR]threshold\f[R] property of the
\f[CR]DynamicsCompressorNode\f[R] interface is a k\-rate
\f[CR]AudioParam\f[R] representing the decibel value above which the
compression will start taking effect.
.PP
The \f[CR]threshold\f[R] property\[cq]s default value is \f[CR]\-24\f[R]
and it can be set between \f[CR]\-100\f[R] and \f[CR]0\f[R].
[IMAGE: The threshold attribute has no effect on signals lowers than its
value, but induce volume reduction on signal stronger than its value.]
The threshold attribute has no effect on signals lowers than its value,

.SH VALUE
An \f[CR]AudioParam\f[R].
.RS
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R] Though the \f[CR]AudioParam\f[R] returned is read\-only,
the value it represents is not.
