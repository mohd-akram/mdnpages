.SH NAME
RTCOutboundRtpStreamStats.pliCount \- RTCOutboundRtpStreamStats:
pliCount property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]pliCount\f[B]\f[R] property of the
\f[CR]RTCOutboundRtpStreamStats\f[R] dictionary states the number of
times the remote peer\[cq]s \f[CR]RTCRtpReceiver\f[R] sent a
\f[B]Picture Loss Indication\f[R] (\f[B]PLI\f[R]) packet to the
\f[CR]RTCRtpSender\f[R] for which this object provides statistics.
.PP
A PLI packet indicates that some amount of encoded video data has been
lost for one or more frames.
.SH VALUE
An integer value indicating the number of times a PLI packet was sent to
this sender by the remote peer\[cq]s \f[CR]RTCRtpReceiver\f[R].
These are sent by the receiver\[cq]s decoder to notify the sender\[cq]s
encoder that an undefined amount of coded video data, which may span
frame boundaries, has been lost.
.RS
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R] This property is only used for video streams.
.RE
.SH USAGE NOTES
Upon receiving a PLI packet, the sender may have responded by sending a
full frame to the remote peer to allow it to re\-synchronize with the
media.
However, the primary purpose of a PLI packet is to allow the
\f[CR]RTCRtpSender\f[R] for which this
\f[CR]RTCOutboundRtpStreamStats\f[R] object provides statistics to
consider techniques to mitigate network performance issues.
This is often achieved by methods such as increasing the compression or
lowering resolution, although the mechanisms available to reduce the bit
rate of the stream vary from codec to codec.
