.SH NAME
MediaTrackSupportedConstraints.autoGainControl \-
MediaTrackSupportedConstraints: autoGainControl property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[CR]MediaTrackSupportedConstraints\f[R] dictionary\[cq]s
\f[B]\f[CB]autoGainControl\f[B]\f[R] property is a read\-only Boolean
value which is present (and set to \f[CR]true\f[R]) in the object
returned by \f[CR]MediaDevices.getSupportedConstraints()\f[R] if and
only if the user agent supports the \f[B]\f[CB]autoGainControl\f[B]\f[R]
constraint.
If the constraint isn\[cq]t supported, it\[cq]s not included in the
list, so this value will never be \f[CR]false\f[R].
.PP
You can access the supported constraints dictionary by calling
\f[CR]navigator.mediaDevices.getSupportedConstraints()\f[R].
.PP
The \f[CR]autoGainControl\f[R] constraint indicates whether or not the
browser offers the ability to automatically control the gain (volume) on
media tracks; this obviously is contingent on whether or not the
individual device supports automatic gain control as well; it\[cq]s
typically a feature provided by microphones.
.SH VALUE
This property is present in the dictionary (and its value is always
\f[CR]true\f[R]) if the user agent supports the
\f[CR]autoGainControl\f[R] constraint.
If the property isn\[cq]t present, this property is missing from the
supported constraints dictionary, and you\[cq]ll get
\f[CR]undefined\f[R] if you try to look at its value.
.SH EXAMPLES
This example displays whether or not your browser supports the
\f[CR]autoGainControl\f[R] constraint.
