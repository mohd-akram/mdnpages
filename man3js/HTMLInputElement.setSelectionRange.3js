.SH NAME
HTMLInputElement.setSelectionRange \- HTMLInputElement:
setSelectionRange() method
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]HTMLInputElement.setSelectionRange()\f[B]\f[R] method
sets the start and end positions of the current text selection in an
\f[CR]<input>\f[R] or \f[CR]<textarea>\f[R] element.
.PP
Optionally, in newer browser versions, you can specify the direction in
which selection should be considered to have occurred.
This lets you indicate, for example, that the selection was set by the
user clicking and dragging from the end of the selected text toward the
beginning.
.PP
This method updates the \f[CR]HTMLInputElement.selectionStart\f[R],
\f[CR]selectionEnd\f[R], and \f[CR]selectionDirection\f[R] properties in
one call.
.PP
Note that according to the \c
.UR
https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/forms.html#concept-input-apply
WHATWG forms spec
.UE \c
\ \f[CR]selectionStart\f[R], \f[CR]selectionEnd\f[R] properties and
\f[CR]setSelectionRange\f[R] method apply only to inputs of types text,
search, URL, tel and password.
Chrome, starting from version 33, throws an exception while accessing
those properties and method on the rest of input types.
For example, on input of type number: \[lq]Failed to read the
`selectionStart' property from `HTMLInputElement': The input
element\[cq]s type (`number') does not support selection\[rq].
.PP
If you wish to select \f[B]all\f[R] text of an input element, you can
use the HTMLInputElement.select() method instead.
