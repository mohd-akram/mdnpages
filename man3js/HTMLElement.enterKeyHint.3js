.SH NAME
HTMLElement.enterKeyHint \- HTMLElement: enterKeyHint property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]enterKeyHint\f[B]\f[R] property is an enumerated property
defining what action label (or icon) to present for the enter key on
virtual keyboards.
It reflects the \f[CR]enterkeyhint\f[R] HTML global attribute and is an
enumerated property, only accepting the following values as a string:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\[aq]enter\[aq]\f[R] typically indicating inserting a new line.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\[aq]done\[aq]\f[R] typically meaning there is nothing more to
input and the input method editor (IME) will be closed.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\[aq]go\[aq]\f[R] typically meaning to take the user to the target
of the text they typed.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\[aq]next\[aq]\f[R] typically taking the user to the next field
that will accept text.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\[aq]previous\[aq]\f[R] typically taking the user to the previous
field that will accept text.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\[aq]search\[aq]\f[R] typically taking the user to the results of
searching for the text they have typed.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]\[aq]send\[aq]\f[R] typically delivering the text to its target.
.PP
If no \f[CR]enterKeyHint\f[R] value has been specified or if it was set
to a different value than the allowed ones, it will return an empty
string.
