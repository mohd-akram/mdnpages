.SH NAME
IdleDeadline \- IdleDeadline
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[CR]IdleDeadline\f[R] interface is used as the data type of the
input parameter to idle callbacks established by calling
\f[CR]Window.requestIdleCallback()\f[R].
It offers a method, \f[CR]timeRemaining()\f[R], which lets you determine
how much longer the user agent estimates it will remain idle and a
property, \f[CR]didTimeout\f[R], which lets you determine if your
callback is executing because its timeout duration expired.
.PP
To learn more about how request callbacks work, see Collaborative
Scheduling of Background Tasks.
.SH INSTANCE PROPERTIES
.TP
\f[B]IdleDeadline.didTimeout\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
A Boolean whose value is \f[CR]true\f[R] if the callback is being
executed because the timeout specified when the idle callback was
installed has expired.
.SH INSTANCE METHODS
.TP
\f[B]IdleDeadline.timeRemaining()\f[R]
Returns a \f[CR]DOMHighResTimeStamp\f[R], which is a floating\-point
value providing an estimate of the number of milliseconds remaining in
the current idle period.
If the idle period is over, the value is 0.
Your callback can call this repeatedly to see if there\[cq]s enough time
left to do more work before returning.
