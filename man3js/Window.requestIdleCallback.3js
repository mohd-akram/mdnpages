.SH NAME
Window.requestIdleCallback \- Window: requestIdleCallback() method
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]window.requestIdleCallback()\f[B]\f[R] method queues a
function to be called during a browser\[cq]s idle periods.
This enables developers to perform background and low priority work on
the main event loop, without impacting latency\-critical events such as
animation and input response.
Functions are generally called in first\-in\-first\-out order; however,
callbacks which have a \f[CR]timeout\f[R] specified may be called
out\-of\-order if necessary in order to run them before the timeout
elapses.
.PP
You can call \f[CR]requestIdleCallback()\f[R] within an idle callback
function to schedule another callback to take place no sooner than the
next pass through the event loop.
.RS
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R] A \f[CR]timeout\f[R] option is strongly recommended for
required work, as otherwise it\[cq]s possible multiple seconds will
elapse before the callback is fired.

.TP
\f[B]callback\f[R]
A reference to a function that should be called in the near future, when
the event loop is idle.
The callback function is passed an \f[CR]IdleDeadline\f[R] object
describing the amount of time available and whether or not the callback
has been run because the timeout period expired.
.TP
\f[B]options\f[R] \f[I](optional)\f[R]
Contains optional configuration parameters.
Currently only one property is defined:
.RS
.TP
\f[B]timeout\f[R]
If the number of milliseconds represented by this parameter has elapsed
and the callback has not already been called, then a task to execute the
callback is queued in the event loop (even if doing so risks causing a
negative performance impact).
\f[CR]timeout\f[R] must be a positive value or it is ignored.
.RE
.SS Return value
An ID which can be used to cancel the callback by passing it into the
\f[CR]window.cancelIdleCallback()\f[R] method.
.SH EXAMPLES
See our complete example in the article Cooperative Scheduling of
Background Tasks API.
