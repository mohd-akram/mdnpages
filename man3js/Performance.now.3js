.SH NAME
Performance.now \- Performance: now() method
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f[B]Note:\f[R] This feature is available in Web Workers.
.PP
The \f[B]\f[CB]performance.now()\f[B]\f[R] method returns a high
resolution timestamp in milliseconds.
It represents the time elapsed since \f[CR]Performance.timeOrigin\f[R]
(the time when navigation has started in window contexts, or the time
when the worker is run in \f[CR]Worker\f[R] and \f[CR]ServiceWorker\f[R]
contexts).
.SH SYNTAX

.EX
now()
.EE
.SS Parameters
None.
.SS Return value
Returns a \f[CR]DOMHighResTimeStamp\f[R] measured in milliseconds.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS \f[CR]Performance.now\f[R] vs.\ \f[CR]Date.now\f[R]
Unlike \f[CR]Date.now\f[R], the timestamps returned by
\f[CR]performance.now()\f[R] are not limited to one\-millisecond
resolution.
Instead, they represent times as floating\-point numbers with up to
microsecond precision.
.PP
Also, \f[CR]Date.now()\f[R] may have been impacted by system and user
clock adjustments, clock skew, etc.
as it is relative to the Unix epoch (1970\-01\-01T00:00:00Z) and
dependent on the system clock.
The \f[CR]performance.now()\f[R] method on the other hand is relative to
the \f[CR]timeOrigin\f[R] property which is a \c

monotonic clock
.UE \c
: its current time never decreases and isn\(cqt subject to adjustments.
.SS \f[CR]performance.now\f[R] specification changes
The semantics of the \f[CR]performance.now()\f[R] method changed between
High Resolution Time Level 1 and Level 2.

.PP
The \f[CR]performance.now()\f[R] method used to be relative to
\f[CR]performance.timing.navigationStart\f[R] property from the
Navigation Timing specification.
This changed and \f[CR]performance.now()\f[R] is now relative to
\f[CR]Performance.timeOrigin\f[R] which avoids clock change risks when
comparing timestamps across webpages.
.IP
.EX
\f[I]// Level 1 (clock change risks)\f[R]
currentTime = performance.timing.navigationStart + performance.now();

\f[I]// Level 2 (no clock change risks)\f[R]
currentTime = performance.timeOrigin + performance.now();
.EE
.SS Ticking during sleep
The specification (Level 2) requires that \f[CR]performance.now()\f[R]
should tick during sleep.
It appears that only Firefox on Windows, and Chromiums on Windows keep
ticking during sleep.

.SH SECURITY REQUIREMENTS
To offer protection against timing attacks and fingerprinting,
\f[CR]performance.now()\f[R] is coarsened based on whether or not the
document is cross\-origin isolated.
.IP \(bu 2
Resolution in isolated contexts: 5 microseconds
.IP \(bu 2
Resolution in non\-isolated contexts: 100 microseconds
.PP
You can use the \f[CR]Window.crossOriginIsolated\f[R] and
\f[CR]WorkerGlobalScope.crossOriginIsolated\f[R] properties to check if
the document is cross\-origin isolated:
.IP
.EX
\f[B]if\f[R] (crossOriginIsolated) {
  \f[I]// Use measureUserAgentSpecificMemory\f[R]
}
.EE
.SH EXAMPLES
.SS Using \f[CR]performance.now()\f[R]
To determine how much time has elapsed since a particular point in your
code, you can do something like this:
.IP
.EX
\f[B]const\f[R] t0 = performance.now();
doSomething();
\f[B]const\f[R] t1 = performance.now();
console.log(\(gaCall to doSomething took ${t1 \- t0} milliseconds.\(ga);
