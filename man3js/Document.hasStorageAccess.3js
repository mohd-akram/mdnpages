.SH NAME
Document.hasStorageAccess \- Document: hasStorageAccess() method
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]hasStorageAccess()\f[B]\f[R] method of the
\f[CR]Document\f[R] interface returns a \f[CR]Promise\f[R] that resolves
with a boolean value indicating whether the document has access to
third\-party, unpartitioned cookies.
.PP
This method is part of the Storage Access API.
.SH SYNTAX
.IP
.EX
hasStorageAccess()
.EE
.SS Parameters
None.
.SS Return value
A \f[CR]Promise\f[R] that resolves with a boolean value indicating
whether the document has access to third\-party cookies \[em]
\f[CR]true\f[R] if it does, and \f[CR]false\f[R] if not.
.PP
The result returned by this method can be inaccurate in a couple of
circumstances:
.IP "1." 3
The user may have active browser settings that block third\-party
cookies; in this case, \f[CR]true\f[R] may be returned even though
third\-party cookies are still inaccessible.
To handle such a situation, you should gracefully handle any errors
resulting in cookie values being unretrievable; for example, inform the
user that access to their personalized settings is blocked and invite
them to sign in again to use them.
.IP "2." 3
The browser might not block third\-party cookie access by default; in
this case, \f[CR]false\f[R] may be returned even though third\-party
cookies are accessible, and storage access wouldn\[cq]t need to be
requested (i.e., via \f[CR]Document.requestStorageAccess()\f[R]).
To get around this issue, you could query \f[CR]Document.cookie\f[R] to
find out whether your cookies are accessible, and call
\f[CR]Document.requestStorageAccess()\f[R] if they are not.

.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R] If the promise gets resolved and a user gesture event
was being processed when the function was originally called, the resolve
handler will run as if a user gesture was being processed, so it will be
able to call APIs that require user activation.
.RE
.SS Exceptions
.TP
\f[B]InvalidStateError\f[R] \f[B]DOMException\f[R]
Thrown if the current \f[CR]Document\f[R] is not yet active.
