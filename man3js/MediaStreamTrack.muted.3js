.SH NAME
MediaStreamTrack.muted \- MediaStreamTrack: muted property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]muted\f[B]\f[R] read\-only property of the
\f[CR]MediaStreamTrack\f[R] interface returns a boolean value indicating
whether or not the track is currently unable to provide media output.
.RS
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R] To implement a way for users to mute and unmute a track,
use the \f[CR]enabled\f[R] property.
When a track is disabled by setting \f[CR]enabled\f[R] to
\f[CR]false\f[R], it generates only empty frames (audio frames in which
every sample is 0, or video frames in which every pixel is black).
.RE
.SH VALUE
A boolean which is \f[CR]true\f[R] if the track is currently muted, or
\f[CR]false\f[R] if the track is currently unmuted.
.RS
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R] When possible, avoid polling \f[CR]muted\f[R] to monitor
the track\(cqs muting status.
Instead, add event listeners for the \f[CR]mute\f[R] and
\f[CR]unmute\f[R] events.
.RE
.SH EXAMPLES
This example counts the number of tracks in an array of
\f[CR]MediaStreamTrack\f[R] objects which are currently muted.
.IP
.EX
\f[B]let\f[R] mutedCount = 0;

trackList.forEach((track) \f[B]=>\f[R] {
  \f[B]if\f[R] (track.muted) {
    mutedCount += 1;
  }
});
