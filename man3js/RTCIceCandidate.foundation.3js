.SH NAME
RTCIceCandidate.foundation \- RTCIceCandidate: foundation property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]foundation\f[B]\f[R] read\-only property of the
\f[CR]RTCIceCandidate\f[R] interface is a string that allows correlation
of candidates from a common network path on multiple
\f[CR]RTCIceTransport\f[R] objects.
.PP
Candidates share the same \f[CR]foundation\f[R] if they:
.IP \(bu 2
have the same type: \(lqhost\(rq, \(lqrelayed\(rq, \(lqserver
reflexive\(rq, or \(lqpeer reflexive\(rq.
.IP \(bu 2
have \(lqbases\(rq that share the same IP address and transport, but not
necessarily the same port.
Note that the IP address is that of the network interface from which the
ICE agent sent the candidate.
.IP \(bu 2
They come from a STUN or TURN server that has the same IP address.
.PP
This is used to help optimize ICE performance while prioritizing and
correlating candidates that appear on multiple
\f[CR]RTCIceTransport\f[R] objects.
.SH VALUE
A string which uniquely identifies the candidate across all
\f[CR]RTCIceTransport\f[R]s on which it is available.
.RS
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R] If \f[CR]port\f[R] is \f[CR]null\f[R] \(em and
\f[CR]port\f[R] is supported by the user agent \(em passing the
candidate to \f[CR]addIceCandidate()\f[R] will fail, throwing an
\f[CR]OperationError\f[R] exception.
.RE
.SH USAGE NOTES
Consider this SDP attribute line (a\-line) which describes an ICE
candidate:
.IP
.EX
a=candidate:4234997325 1 udp 2043278322 192.0.2.172 44323 typ host
.EE
.PP
The field \f[CR]\(dq4234997325\(dq\f[R] is the foundation.
.SH EXAMPLES
This code snippet uses the \f[CR]foundation\f[R] of two candidates to
determine if they\(cqre actually the same candidate.
.IP
.EX
\f[B]if\f[R] (candidate1.foundation === candidate2.foundation) {
  \f[I]/* the two candidates are the same, even if they\(aqre on\f[R]
\f[I]     different transports */\f[R]
}
.EE
