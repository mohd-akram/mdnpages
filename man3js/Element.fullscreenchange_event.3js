.SH NAME
Element.fullscreenchange_event \- Element: fullscreenchange event
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[CR]fullscreenchange\f[R] event is fired immediately after an
\f[CR]Element\f[R] switches into or out of fullscreen mode.
.PP
This event is sent to the \f[CR]Element\f[R] which is transitioning into
or out of fullscreen mode.
.PP
To find out whether the \f[CR]Element\f[R] is entering or exiting
fullscreen mode, check the value of
\f[CR]Document.fullscreenElement\f[R]: if this value is \f[CR]null\f[R]
then the element is exiting fullscreen mode, otherwise it is entering
fullscreen mode.
.PP
This event is not cancelable.
.SH SYNTAX
Use the event name in methods like \f[CR]addEventListener()\f[R], or set
an event handler property.

.EX
addEventListener(\[dq]fullscreenchange\[dq], (event) \f[B]=>\f[R] {});

onfullscreenchange = (event) \f[B]=>\f[R] {};
.EE
.SH EVENT TYPE
A generic \f[CR]Event\f[R].
.SH EXAMPLES
In this example, a handler for the \f[CR]fullscreenchange\f[R] event is
added to the element whose ID is \f[CR]fullscreen\-div\f[R].
.PP
If the user clicks on the \[lq]Toggle Fullscreen Mode\[rq] button, the
\f[CR]click\f[R] handler will toggle fullscreen mode for the
\f[CR]div\f[R].
If \f[CR]document.fullscreenElement\f[R] has a value it will exit
fullscreen mode.
If not, the div will be placed into fullscreen mode.
.PP
Remember that by the time the \f[CR]fullscreenchange\f[R] event is
handled, the status of the element has already changed.
So if the change is to fullscreen mode,
\f[CR]document.fullscreenElement\f[R] will point to the element that is
now in fullscreen mode.
On the other hand, if \f[CR]document.fullscreenElement\f[R] is null,
fullscreen mode has been canceled.
.PP
What that means to the example code is that, if an element is currently
in fullscreen mode, the \f[CR]fullscreenchange\f[R] handler logs the
\f[CR]id\f[R] of the fullscreen element to the console.
If \f[CR]document.fullscreenElement\f[R] is null, the code logs a
message that the change is to leave fullscreen mode.
