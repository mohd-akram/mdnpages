.SH NAME
Window.history \- Window: history property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[CR]Window.history\f[R] read\-only property returns a reference to
the \f[CR]History\f[R] object, which provides an interface for
manipulating the browser \f[I]session history\f[R] (pages visited in the
tab or frame that the current page is loaded in).
.PP
See Manipulating the browser history for examples and details.
In particular, that article explains security features of the
\f[CR]pushState()\f[R] and \f[CR]replaceState()\f[R] methods that you
should be aware of before using them.
.SH VALUE
A reference to the \f[CR]History\f[R] object.
.SH EXAMPLES
.IP
.EX
history.back(); \f[I]// equivalent to clicking back button\f[R]
history.go(\-1); \f[I]// equivalent to history.back();\f[R]
.EE
.SH NOTES
For top\-level pages you can see the list of pages in the session
history, accessible via the \f[CR]History\f[R] object, in the
browser\[cq]s dropdowns next to the back and forward buttons.
.PP
For security reasons the \f[CR]History\f[R] object doesn\[cq]t allow the
non\-privileged code to access the URLs of other pages in the session
history, but it does allow it to navigate the session history.
.PP
There is no way to clear the session history or to disable the
back/forward navigation from unprivileged code.
The closest available solution is the \f[CR]location.replace()\f[R]
method, which replaces the current item of the session history with the
provided URL.
