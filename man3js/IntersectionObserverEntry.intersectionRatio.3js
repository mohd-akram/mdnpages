.SH NAME
IntersectionObserverEntry.intersectionRatio \-
IntersectionObserverEntry: intersectionRatio property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[CR]IntersectionObserverEntry\f[R] interface\[cq]s read\-only
\f[B]\f[CB]intersectionRatio\f[B]\f[R] property tells you how much of
the target element is currently visible within the root\[cq]s
intersection ratio, as a value between 0.0 and 1.0.
.SH VALUE
A number between 0.0 and 1.0 which indicates how much of the target
element is actually visible within the root\[cq]s intersection
rectangle.
More precisely, this value is the ratio of the area of the intersection
rectangle (\f[CR]intersectionRect\f[R]) to the area of the target\[cq]s
bounds rectangle (\f[CR]boundingClientRect\f[R]).
.PP
If the area of the target\[cq]s bounds rectangle is zero, the returned
value is 1 if \f[CR]isIntersecting\f[R] is \f[CR]true\f[R] or 0 if not.
.SH EXAMPLES
In this simple example, an intersection callback sets each target
element\[cq]s \f[CR]opacity\f[R] to the intersection ratio of that
element with the root.
.IP
.EX
\f[B]function\f[R] intersectionCallback(entries) {
  entries.forEach((entry) \f[B]=>\f[R] {
    entry.target.style.opacity = entry.intersectionRatio;
  });
}

changes.
