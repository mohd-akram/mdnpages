.SH NAME
HTMLTableRowElement \- HTMLTableRowElement
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]HTMLTableRowElement\f[B]\f[R] interface provides special
properties and methods (beyond the \f[CR]HTMLElement\f[R] interface it
also has available to it by inheritance) for manipulating the layout and
presentation of rows in an HTML table.
.SH INSTANCE PROPERTIES
\f[I]Inherits properties from its parent, \f[CI]HTMLElement\f[I].\f[R]
.TP
\f[B]HTMLTableRowElement.cells\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
Returns a live \f[CR]HTMLCollection\f[R] containing the cells in the
row.
The \f[CR]HTMLCollection\f[R] is live and is automatically updated when
cells are added or removed.
.TP
\f[B]HTMLTableRowElement.rowIndex\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
Returns a \f[CR]long\f[R] value which gives the logical position of the
row within the entire table.
If the row is not part of a table, returns \f[CR]\-1\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]HTMLTableRowElement.sectionRowIndex\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
Returns a \f[CR]long\f[R] value which gives the logical position of the
row within the table section it belongs to.
If the row is not part of a section, returns \f[CR]\-1\f[R].
.SH INSTANCE METHODS
\f[I]Inherits methods from its parent, \f[CI]HTMLElement\f[I]\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]deleteCell(index)\f[R]
Removes the cell corresponding to \f[CR]index\f[R].
If \f[CR]index\f[R] is \f[CR]\-1\f[R], the last cell of the row is
removed.
If \f[CR]index\f[R] is less than \f[CR]\-1\f[R] or greater than the
amount of cells in the collection, a \f[CR]DOMException\f[R] with the
value \f[CR]IndexSizeError\f[R] is raised.
.TP
\f[B]insertCell(index)\f[R]
Returns an \f[CR]HTMLTableCellElement\f[R] representing a new cell of
the row.
The cell is inserted in the collection of cells immediately before the
given \f[CR]index\f[R] position in the row.
If \f[CR]index\f[R] is \f[CR]\-1\f[R], the new cell is appended to the
collection.
If \f[CR]index\f[R] is less than \f[CR]\-1\f[R] or greater than the
number of cells in the collection, a \f[CR]DOMException\f[R] with the
value \f[CR]IndexSizeError\f[R] is raised.
.SH DEPRECATED PROPERTIES
.RS
.PP
\f[B]Warning:\f[R] These properties have been deprecated and should no
longer be used.
They are documented primarily to help understand older code bases.
.RE
.TP
\f[B]HTMLTableRowElement.align\f[R] \f[I](deprecated)\f[R]
A string containing an enumerated value reflecting the \f[CR]align\f[R]
attribute.
It indicates the alignment of the element\[cq]s contents with respect to
the surrounding context.
The possible values are \f[CR]\[dq]left\[dq]\f[R],
\f[CR]\[dq]right\[dq]\f[R], and \f[CR]\[dq]center\[dq]\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]HTMLTableRowElement.bgColor\f[R] \f[I](deprecated)\f[R]
A string containing the background color of the cells.
It reflects the obsolete \f[CR]bgColor\f[R] attribute.
.TP
\f[B]HTMLTableRowElement.ch\f[R] \f[I](deprecated)\f[R]
A string containing one single character.
This character is the one to align all the cell of a column on.
It reflects the \f[CR]char\f[R] and default to the decimal points
associated with the language, e.g.\ \f[CR]\[aq].\[aq]\f[R] for English,
or \f[CR]\[aq],\[aq]\f[R] for French.
This property was optional and was not very well supported.
.TP
\f[B]HTMLTableRowElement.chOff\f[R] \f[I](deprecated)\f[R]
A string containing an integer indicating how many characters must be
left at the right (for left\-to\-right scripts; or at the left for
right\-to\-left scripts) of the character defined by
\f[CR]HTMLTableRowElement.ch\f[R].
This property was optional and was not very well supported.
.TP
\f[B]HTMLTableRowElement.vAlign\f[R] \f[I](deprecated)\f[R]
A string representing an enumerated value indicating how the content of
the cell must be vertically aligned.
It reflects the \f[CR]valign\f[R] attribute and can have one of the
following values: \f[CR]\[dq]top\[dq]\f[R], \f[CR]\[dq]middle\[dq]\f[R],
\f[CR]\[dq]bottom\[dq]\f[R], or \f[CR]\[dq]baseline\[dq]\f[R].
