.SH NAME
Animation \- Animation
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]Animation\f[B]\f[R] interface of the Web Animations API
represents a single animation player and provides playback controls and
a timeline for an animation node or source.
.SH CONSTRUCTOR
.TP
\f[B]Animation()\f[R]
Creates a new \f[CR]Animation\f[R] object instance.
.SH INSTANCE PROPERTIES
.TP
\f[B]Animation.currentTime\f[R]
The current time value of the animation in milliseconds, whether running
or paused.
If the animation lacks a \f[CR]timeline\f[R], is inactive or hasn\[cq]t
been played yet, its value is \f[CR]null\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]Animation.effect\f[R]
Gets and sets the \f[CR]AnimationEffect\f[R] associated with this
animation.
This will usually be a \f[CR]KeyframeEffect\f[R] object.
.TP
\f[B]Animation.finished\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
Returns the current finished Promise for this animation.
.TP
\f[B]Animation.id\f[R]
Gets and sets the \f[CR]String\f[R] used to identify the animation.
.TP
\f[B]Animation.overallProgress\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R] \f[I](experimental)\f[R]
Returns a number between \f[CR]0\f[R] and \f[CR]1\f[R] indicating the
animation\[cq]s overall progress towards its finished state.
.TP
\f[B]Animation.pending\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
Indicates whether the animation is currently waiting for an asynchronous
operation such as initiating playback or pausing a running animation.
.TP
\f[B]Animation.playState\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
Returns an enumerated value describing the playback state of an
animation.
.TP
\f[B]Animation.playbackRate\f[R]
Gets or sets the playback rate of the animation.
.TP
\f[B]Animation.ready\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
Returns the current ready Promise for this animation.
.TP
\f[B]Animation.replaceState\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
Indicates whether the animation is active, has been automatically
removed after being replaced by another animation, or has been
explicitly persisted by a call to \f[CR]Animation.persist()\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]Animation.startTime\f[R]
Gets or sets the scheduled time when an animation\[cq]s playback should
begin.
.TP
\f[B]Animation.timeline\f[R]
Gets or sets the \f[CR]timeline\f[R] associated with this animation.
.SH INSTANCE METHODS
.TP
\f[B]Animation.cancel()\f[R]
Clears all \f[CR]keyframeEffects\f[R] caused by this animation and
aborts its playback.
.TP
\f[B]Animation.commitStyles()\f[R]
Commits the current styling state of an animation to the element being
animated, even after that animation has been removed.
It will cause the current styling state to be written to the element
being animated, in the form of properties inside a \f[CR]style\f[R]
attribute.
.TP
\f[B]Animation.finish()\f[R]
Seeks either end of an animation, depending on whether the animation is
playing or reversing.
.TP
\f[B]Animation.pause()\f[R]
Suspends playing of an animation.
.TP
\f[B]Animation.persist()\f[R]
Explicitly persists an animation, preventing it from being automatically
removed when another animation replaces it.
.TP
\f[B]Animation.play()\f[R]
Starts or resumes playing of an animation, or begins the animation again
if it previously finished.
.TP
\f[B]Animation.reverse()\f[R]
Reverses playback direction, stopping at the start of the animation.
If the animation is finished or unplayed, it will play from end to
beginning.
.TP
\f[B]Animation.updatePlaybackRate()\f[R]
Sets the speed of an animation after first synchronizing its playback
position.
.SH EVENTS
.TP
\f[B]cancel\f[R]
Fires when the \f[CR]Animation.cancel()\f[R] method is called or when
the animation enters the \f[CR]\[dq]idle\[dq]\f[R] play state from
another state.
.TP
\f[B]finish\f[R]
Fires when the animation finishes playing.
.TP
\f[B]remove\f[R]
Fires when the animation is automatically removed by the browser.
.SH ACCESSIBILITY CONCERNS
Blinking and flashing animation can be problematic for people with
cognitive concerns such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder
(ADHD).
Additionally, certain kinds of motion can be a trigger for Vestibular
disorders, epilepsy, and migraine, and Scotopic sensitivity.
.PP
Consider providing a mechanism for pausing or disabling animation, as
well as using the Reduced Motion Media Query (or equivalent user agent
client hint \f[CR]Sec\-CH\-Prefers\-Reduced\-Motion\f[R]) to create a
complimentary experience for users who have expressed a preference for
no animated experiences.
