PerformanceMark \- PerformanceMark
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f[B]Note:\f[R] This feature is available in Web Workers.
.PP
\f[B]\f[CB]PerformanceMark\f[B]\f[R] is an interface for
\f[CR]PerformanceEntry\f[R] objects with an \f[CR]entryType\f[R] of
\f[CR]\[dq]mark\[dq]\f[R].
.PP
Entries of this type are typically created by calling
\f[CR]performance.mark()\f[R] to add a \f[I]named\f[R]
\f[CR]DOMHighResTimeStamp\f[R] (the \f[I]mark\f[R]) to the browser\[cq]s
performance timeline.
To create a performance mark that isn\[cq]t added to the browser\[cq]s
performance timeline, use the constructor.
.SH CONSTRUCTOR
.TP
\f[B]PerformanceMark()\f[R]
Creates a new \f[CR]PerformanceMark\f[R] object that isn\[cq]t added to
the browser\[cq]s performance timeline.
.SH INSTANCE PROPERTIES
This interface extends the following \f[CR]PerformanceEntry\f[R]
properties by qualifying/constraining the properties as follows:
.TP
\f[B]PerformanceEntry.entryType\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
Returns \f[CR]\[dq]mark\[dq]\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]PerformanceEntry.name\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
Returns the name given to the mark when it was created via a call to
\f[CR]performance.mark()\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]PerformanceEntry.startTime\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
Returns the \f[CR]DOMHighResTimeStamp\f[R] when
\f[CR]performance.mark()\f[R] was called.
.TP
\f[B]PerformanceEntry.duration\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
Returns \f[CR]0\f[R].
(A mark has no \f[I]duration\f[R].)
.PP
This interface also supports the following properties:
.TP
\f[B]PerformanceMark.detail\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
Returns arbitrary metadata that has been included in the mark upon
construction.
.SH INSTANCE METHODS
This interface has no methods.
