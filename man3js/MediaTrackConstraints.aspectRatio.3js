.SH NAME
MediaTrackConstraints.aspectRatio \- MediaTrackConstraints: aspectRatio
property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[CR]MediaTrackConstraints\f[R] dictionary\[cq]s
\f[B]\f[CB]aspectRatio\f[B]\f[R] property is a
\f[CR]ConstrainDouble\f[R] describing the requested or mandatory
constraints placed upon the value of the \f[CR]aspectRatio\f[R]
constrainable property.
.PP
If needed, you can determine whether or not this constraint is supported
by checking the value of
\f[CR]MediaTrackSupportedConstraints.aspectRatio\f[R] as returned by a
call to \f[CR]MediaDevices.getSupportedConstraints()\f[R].
However, typically this is unnecessary since browsers will ignore any
constraints they\[cq]re unfamiliar with.
.SH VALUE
A \f[CR]ConstrainDouble\f[R] describing the acceptable or required
value(s) for a video track\[cq]s aspect ratio.
The value is the width divided by the height and is rounded to ten
decimal places.
For example, the standard high\-definition video aspect ratio of 16:9
can be computed as 1920/1080, or 1.7777777778.
.PP
If this value is a number, the user agent will attempt to obtain media
whose aspect ratio is as close as possible to this number given the
capabilities of the hardware and the other constraints specified.
Otherwise, the value of this \f[CR]ConstrainDouble\f[R] will guide the
user agent in its efforts to provide an exact match to the required
aspect ratio (if \f[CR]exact\f[R] is specified or both \f[CR]min\f[R]
and \f[CR]max\f[R] are provided and have the same value) or to a
best\-possible value.
