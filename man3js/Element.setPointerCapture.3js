.SH NAME
Element.setPointerCapture \- Element: setPointerCapture() method
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]setPointerCapture()\f[B]\f[R] method of the
\f[CR]Element\f[R] interface is used to designate a specific element as
the \f[I]capture target\f[R] of future pointer events.
Subsequent events for the pointer will be targeted at the capture
element until capture is released (via
\f[CR]Element.releasePointerCapture()\f[R] or the \f[CR]pointerup\f[R]
event is fired).
.RS
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R] Pointer capture will cause the target to capture all
subsequent pointer events as if they were occurring over the capturing
target.
Accordingly, \f[CR]pointerover\f[R], \f[CR]pointerenter\f[R],
\f[CR]pointerleave\f[R], and \f[CR]pointerout\f[R] \f[B]will not
fire\f[R] as long as this capture is set.

\ will be called on the element when a \f[CR]pointerdown\f[R] event
triggers.
The capture can be released manually by calling
\f[CR]element.releasePointerCapture\f[R] on the target element, or it
will be implicitly released after a \f[CR]pointerup\f[R] or
\f[CR]pointercancel\f[R] event.
.RE
.SS Overview of pointer capture
\f[I]Pointer capture\f[R] allows events for a particular \f[I]pointer
event\f[R] (\f[CR]PointerEvent\f[R]) to be re\-targeted to a particular
element instead of the normal (or \f[I]hit test\f[R]) target at a
pointer\[cq]s location.
This can be used to ensure that an element continues to receive pointer
events even if the pointer device\[cq]s contact moves off the element
(such as by scrolling or panning).

.SS Parameters
.TP
\f[B]pointerId\f[R]
The \f[CR]pointerId\f[R] of a \f[CR]PointerEvent\f[R] object.
.SS Return value
None (\f[CR]undefined\f[R]).
.SS Exceptions
.TP
\f[B]NotFoundError\f[R] \f[B]DOMException\f[R]
Thrown if \f[CR]pointerId\f[R] does not match any active pointer.
.SH EXAMPLES
This example sets pointer capture on a \f[CR]<div>\f[R] when you press
down on it.
This lets you slide the element horizontally, even when your pointer
moves outside of its boundaries.
