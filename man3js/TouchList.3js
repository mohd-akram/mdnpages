TouchList \- TouchList
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]TouchList\f[B]\f[R] interface represents a list of
contact points on a touch surface.
For example, if the user has three fingers on the touch surface (such as
a screen or trackpad), the corresponding \f[CR]TouchList\f[R] object
would have one \f[CR]Touch\f[R] object for each finger, for a total of
three entries.

Modern APIs use types that wrap around ECMAScript array types instead,
so you can treat them like ECMAScript arrays, and at the same time
impose additional semantics on their usage (such as making their items
read\-only).
