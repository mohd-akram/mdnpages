.SH NAME
VideoTrack.selected \- VideoTrack: selected property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]VideoTrack\f[B]\f[R] property
\f[B]\f[CB]selected\f[B]\f[R] controls whether or not a particular video
track is active.
.SH VALUE
The \f[CR]selected\f[R] property is a Boolean whose value is
\f[CR]true\f[R] if the track is active.
Only a single video track can be active at any given time, so setting
this property to \f[CR]true\f[R] for one track while another track is
active will make that other track inactive.
