.SH EXAMPLES
You might want to know when the connection has been closed so that you
can update the UI or, perhaps, save data about the closed connection.
Given that you have a variable called \f[CR]exampleSocket\f[R] that
refers to an opened \f[CR]WebSocket\f[R], this handler would handle the
situation where the socket has been closed.
.IP
.EX
exampleSocket.addEventListener(\[dq]close\[dq], (event) \f[B]=>\f[R] {
  console.log(\[dq]The connection has been closed successfully.\[dq]);
});
.EE
.PP
You can perform the same actions using the event handler property, like
this:
.IP
.EX
exampleSocket.onclose = (event) \f[B]=>\f[R] {
  console.log(\[dq]The connection has been closed successfully.\[dq]);
};
