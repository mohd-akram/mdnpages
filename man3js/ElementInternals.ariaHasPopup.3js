\f[B]Note:\f[R] Setting aria attributes on \f[CR]ElementInternals\f[R]
allows default semantics to be defined on a custom element.
These may be overwritten by author\-defined attributes, but ensure that
default semantics are retained should the author delete those
attributes, or fail to add them at all.
