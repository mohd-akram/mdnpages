.SH NAME
MediaStreamTrack.getConstraints \- MediaStreamTrack: getConstraints()
method
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]getConstraints()\f[B]\f[R] method of the
\f[CR]MediaStreamTrack\f[R] interface returns a
\f[CR]MediaTrackConstraints\f[R] object containing the set of
constraints most recently established for the track using a prior call
to \f[CR]applyConstraints()\f[R].
These constraints indicate values and ranges of values that the website
or application has specified are required or acceptable for the included
constrainable properties.
.PP
Constraints can be used to ensure that the media meets certain
guidelines you prefer.
For example, you may prefer high definition video but require that the
frame rate be a little low to help keep the data rate low enough not
overtax the network.
Constraints can also specify ideal and/or acceptable sizes or ranges of
sizes.
See Capabilities, constraints, and settings for details on how to work
with constrainable properties.

getConstraints()
.EE
.SS Parameters
None.
.SS Return value
A \f[CR]MediaTrackConstraints\f[R] object which indicates the
constrainable properties the website or app most recently set using
\f[CR]applyConstraints()\f[R].
The properties in the returned object are listed in the same order as
when they were set, and only properties specifically set by the site or
app are included.
.RS
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R] The returned set of constraints doesn\[cq]t necessarily
describe the actual state of the media.
Even if any of the constraints couldn\[cq]t be met, they are still
included in the returned object as originally set by the site\[cq]s
code.
To get the currently active settings for all constrainable properties,
you should instead call \f[CR]getSettings()\f[R].
.RE
.SH EXAMPLES
This example obtains the current constraints for a track, sets the
\f[CR]facingMode\f[R], and applies the updated constraints.
