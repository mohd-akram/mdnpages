.SH NAME
RTCErrorEvent \- RTCErrorEvent
.SH SYNOPSIS
The WebRTC API\[cq]s \f[B]\f[CB]RTCErrorEvent\f[B]\f[R] interface
represents an error sent to a WebRTC object.
It\[cq]s based on the standard \f[CR]Event\f[R] interface, but adds
RTC\-specific information describing the error, as shown below.
.SH CONSTRUCTOR
.TP
\f[B]RTCErrorEvent()\f[R]
Creates and returns a new \f[CR]RTCErrorEvent\f[R] object.
.SH INSTANCE PROPERTIES
\f[I]In addition to the standard properties available on the
\f[CI]Event\f[I] interface, \f[CI]RTCErrorEvent\f[I] also includes the
following:\f[R]
.TP
\f[B]error\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
An \f[CR]RTCError\f[R] object specifying the error which occurred; this
object includes the type of error that occurred, information about where
the error occurred (such as which line number in the SDP or what SCTP
cause code was at issue).
.SH INSTANCE METHODS
\f[I]No additional methods are provided beyond any found on the parent
interface, \f[CI]Event\f[I].\f[R]
.SH DESCRIPTION
There are other data types used for error events in WebRTC, as needed
for errors with special information sharing requirements.
The most common of these is probably
\f[CR]RTCPeerConnectionIceErrorEvent\f[R], used by the
\f[CR]icecandidateerror\f[R] event, which signals an error that has
occurred while gathering ICE candidates during connection negotiation.
