.SH NAME
EcdhKeyDeriveParams \- EcdhKeyDeriveParams
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]EcdhKeyDeriveParams\f[B]\f[R] dictionary of the Web
Crypto API represents the object that should be passed as the
\f[CR]algorithm\f[R] parameter into \f[CR]SubtleCrypto.deriveKey()\f[R]
and \f[CR]SubtleCrypto.deriveBits()\f[R], when using the ECDH or X25519
algorithms.
.PP
ECDH enables two people who each have a key pair consisting of a public
and a private key to derive a shared secret.
They exchange public keys and use the combination of their private key
and the other entity\[cq]s public key to derive a secret key that they
\[em] and no one else \[em] share.
.PP
The parameters for ECDH \f[CR]deriveKey()\f[R] therefore include the
other entity\[cq]s public key, which is combined with this entity\[cq]s
private key to derive the shared secret.
.SH INSTANCE PROPERTIES
.TP
\f[B]name\f[R]
A string.
This should be set to \f[CR]ECDH\f[R] or \f[CR]X25519\f[R], depending on
the algorithm used.
.TP
\f[B]public\f[R]
A \f[CR]CryptoKey\f[R] object representing the public key of the other
entity.
.SH EXAMPLES
See the examples for \f[CR]SubtleCrypto.deriveKey()\f[R] and
\f[CR]SubtleCrypto.deriveBits()\f[R].
