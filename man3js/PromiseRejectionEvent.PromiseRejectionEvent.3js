.SH NAME
PromiseRejectionEvent.PromiseRejectionEvent \- PromiseRejectionEvent:
PromiseRejectionEvent() constructor
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f[B]Note:\f[R] This feature is available in Web Workers.
.PP
The \f[B]\f[CB]PromiseRejectionEvent()\f[B]\f[R] constructor returns a
new \f[CR]PromiseRejectionEvent\f[R] object, which represents events
fired when a JavaScript \f[CR]Promise\f[R] is rejected.
.PP
With promise rejection events, it becomes possible to detect and report
promises which fail and whose failures go unnoticed.
It also becomes easier to write a global handler for errors.
.PP
There are two types of \f[CR]PromiseRejectionEvent\f[R]:
\f[CR]unhandledrejection\f[R] is sent by the JavaScript runtime when a
promise is rejected but the rejection goes unhandled.
A \f[CR]rejectionhandled\f[R] event is emitted if a promise is rejected
but the rejection is caught by a rejection handler.

.SS Parameters
.TP
\f[B]type\f[R]
A string with the name of the event.
It is case\-sensitive and browsers set it to \f[CR]rejectionhandled\f[R]
or \f[CR]unhandledrejection\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]options\f[R]
An object that, \f[I]in addition of the properties defined in
\f[CI]Event()\f[I]\f[R], can have the following properties:
.RS
.TP
\f[B]promise\f[R]
The \f[CR]Promise\f[R] that was rejected.
.TP
\f[B]reason\f[R]
Any value or \f[CR]Object\f[R] which represents the reason the promise
was rejected.
This can be anything from a numeric error code to an error string to an
object which contains detailed information describing the situation
resulting in the promise being rejected.
.RE
.SS Return value
A new \f[CR]PromiseRejectionEvent\f[R] object configured as specified by
the parameters.
.SH EXAMPLES
This example creates a new \f[CR]unhandledrejection\f[R] event for the
promise \f[CR]myPromise\f[R] with the reason being the string \(lqMy
house is on fire\(rq.
The \f[CR]reason\f[R] could just as easily be a number, or even an
object with detailed information including the home address, how serious
the fire is, and the phone number of an emergency contact who should be
notified.
