.SH NAME
Request.destination \- Request: destination property
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f[B]Note:\f[R] This feature is available in Web Workers.
.PP
The \f[B]\f[CB]destination\f[B]\f[R] read\-only property of the
\f[B]\f[CB]Request\f[B]\f[R] interface returns a string describing the
type of content being requested.
.PP
The string must be one of the \f[CR]audio\f[R], \f[CR]audioworklet\f[R],
\f[CR]document\f[R], \f[CR]embed\f[R], \f[CR]fencedframe\f[R],
\f[CR]font\f[R], \f[CR]frame\f[R], \f[CR]iframe\f[R], \f[CR]image\f[R],
\f[CR]json\f[R], \f[CR]manifest\f[R], \f[CR]object\f[R],
\f[CR]paintworklet\f[R], \f[CR]report\f[R], \f[CR]script\f[R],
\f[CR]sharedworker\f[R], \f[CR]style\f[R], \f[CR]track\f[R],
\f[CR]video\f[R], \f[CR]worker\f[R] or \f[CR]xslt\f[R] strings, or the
empty string, which is the default value.
.PP
The \f[CR]destination\f[R] is used by the user agent to, for example,
help determine which set of rules to follow for CORS purposes, or how to
navigate any complicated code paths that affect how specific types of
request get handled.
.PP
These destinations vary substantially in how they operate.
Some are data receptacles, where the received data is stored for
processing later.
Others are script\-based, in which case the received data is delivered
to a script by calling it and passing the data along.
Script\-based destinations include \f[CR]<script>\f[R] elements, as well
as any of the \f[CR]Worklet\f[R]\-based destinations (including
subclasses like \f[CR]AudioWorklet\f[R]), and the
\f[CR]Worker\f[R]\-based destinations, including
\f[CR]ServiceWorker\f[R] and \f[CR]SharedWorker\f[R].
.SH VALUE
A string which indicates the type of content the request is asking for.
This type is much broader than the usual document type values (such as
\f[CR]\(dqdocument\(dq\f[R] or \f[CR]\(dqmanifest\(dq\f[R]), and may
include contextual cues such as \f[CR]\(dqimage\(dq\f[R] or
\f[CR]\(dqworker\(dq\f[R] or \f[CR]\(dqaudioworklet\(dq\f[R].
.PP
Possible values are:
.TP
\f[B]\(dq\(dq\f[R]
The empty string is the default value, and is used for destinations that
do not have their own value.
This is the value when requests are made using the following APIs (among
others):

.SH EXAMPLES
In the following snippet, we create a new request using the
\f[CR]Request()\f[R] constructor (for an image file in the same
directory as the script), then save the request\(cqs destination:
.IP
.EX
\f[B]const\f[R] myRequest = \f[B]new\f[R] Request(\(dqflowers.jpg\(dq);
\f[B]const\f[R] myDestination = myRequest.destination; \f[I]// returns the empty string by default\f[R]
