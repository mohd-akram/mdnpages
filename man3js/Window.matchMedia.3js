.SH NAME
Window.matchMedia \- Window: matchMedia() method
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[CR]Window\f[R] interface\[cq]s \f[B]\f[CB]matchMedia()\f[B]\f[R]
method returns a new \f[CR]MediaQueryList\f[R] object that can then be
used to determine if the \f[CR]document\f[R] matches the media query
string, as well as to monitor the document to detect when it matches (or
stops matching) that media query.
.SH SYNTAX
.IP
.EX
matchMedia(mediaQueryString)
.EE
.SS Parameters
.TP
\f[B]mediaQueryString\f[R]
A string specifying the media query to parse into a
\f[CR]MediaQueryList\f[R].
.SS Return value
A new \f[CR]MediaQueryList\f[R] object for the media query.
Use this object\[cq]s properties and events to detect matches and to
monitor for changes to those matches over time.
.SH USAGE NOTES
You can use the returned media query to perform both instantaneous and
event\-driven checks to see if the document matches the media query.
.PP
To perform a one\-time, instantaneous check to see if the document
matches the media query, look at the value of the \f[CR]matches\f[R]
property, which will be \f[CR]true\f[R] if the document meets the media
query\[cq]s requirements.
.PP
If you need to be kept aware of whether or not the document matches the
media query at all times, you can instead watch for the
\f[CR]change\f[R] event to be delivered to the object.
There\[cq]s a good example of this in the article on
\f[CR]Window.devicePixelRatio\f[R].
.SH EXAMPLES
This example runs the media query \f[CR](max\-width: 600px)\f[R] and
displays the value of the resulting \f[CR]MediaQueryList\f[R]\[cq]s
\f[CR]matches\f[R] property in a \f[CR]<span>\f[R]; as a result, the
output will say \[lq]true\[rq] if the viewport is less than or equal to
600 pixels wide, and will say \[lq]false\[rq] if the window is wider
than that.
.SS JavaScript
.IP
.EX
let mql = window.matchMedia(\[dq](max\-width: 600px)\[dq]);

document.querySelector(\[dq].mq\-value\[dq]).innerText = mql.matches;
.EE
.PP
The JavaScript code passes the media query to match into
\f[CR]matchMedia()\f[R] to compile it, then sets the \f[CR]<span>\f[R]`s
\f[CR]innerText\f[R] to the value of the results' \f[CR]matches\f[R]
property, so that it indicates whether or not the document matches the
media query at the moment the page was loaded.
.SS HTML
.IP
.EX
<span class=\[dq]mq\-value\[dq]></span>
.EE
.PP
A simple \f[CR]<span>\f[R] to receive the output.
.SS Result
