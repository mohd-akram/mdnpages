.SH NAME
WaveShaperNode.curve \- WaveShaperNode: curve property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[CR]curve\f[R] property of the \f[CR]WaveShaperNode\f[R] interface
is a \f[CR]Float32Array\f[R] of numbers describing the distortion to
apply.
.PP
The mid\-element of the array is applied to any signal value of
\f[CR]0\f[R], the first one to signal values of \f[CR]\-1\f[R], and the
last to signal values of \f[CR]1\f[R]; values lower than \f[CR]\-1\f[R]
or greater than \f[CR]1\f[R] are treated like \f[CR]\-1\f[R] or
\f[CR]1\f[R] respectively.
.PP
If necessary, intermediate values of the distortion curve are linearly
interpolated.
.RS
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R] The array can be a \f[CR]null\f[R] value: in that case,
no distortion is applied to the input signal.
.RE
.SH VALUE
A \f[CR]Float32Array\f[R].
.SH EXAMPLES
See \f[CR]BaseAudioContext.createWaveShaper()\f[R] for example code.
