.SH NAME
SpeechRecognitionEvent.results \- SpeechRecognitionEvent: results
property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]results\f[B]\f[R] read\-only property of the
\f[CR]SpeechRecognitionEvent\f[R] interface returns a
\f[CR]SpeechRecognitionResultList\f[R] object representing all the
speech recognition results for the current session.
.PP
Specifically this object will contain all final results that have been
returned, followed by the current best hypothesis for all interim
results.
When subsequent \f[CR]result\f[R] events are fired, interim results may
be overwritten by a newer interim result or by a final result \(em they
may even be removed, if they are at the end of the \(lqresults\(rq array
and the array length decreases.
Final results on the other hand will not be overwritten or removed.
.SH VALUE
A \f[CR]SpeechRecognitionResultList\f[R] object.
