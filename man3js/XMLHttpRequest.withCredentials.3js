.SH NAME
XMLHttpRequest.withCredentials \- XMLHttpRequest: withCredentials
property
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f[B]Note:\f[R] This feature is available in Web Workers, except for
Service Workers.
.PP
The \f[B]\f[CB]XMLHttpRequest.withCredentials\f[B]\f[R] property is a
boolean value that indicates whether or not cross\-site
\f[CR]Access\-Control\f[R] requests should be made using credentials
such as cookies, authentication headers or TLS client certificates.
Setting \f[CR]withCredentials\f[R] has no effect on same\-origin
requests.
.PP
In addition, this flag is also used to indicate when cookies are to be
ignored in the response.
The default is \f[CR]false\f[R].
\f[CR]XMLHttpRequest\f[R] responses from a different domain cannot set
cookie values for their own domain unless \f[CR]withCredentials\f[R] is
set to \f[CR]true\f[R] before making the request.
The third\-party cookies obtained by setting \f[CR]withCredentials\f[R]
to \f[CR]true\f[R] will still honor same\-origin policy and hence can
not be accessed by the requesting script through document.cookie or from
response headers.

\f[B]Note:\f[R] This never affects same\-origin requests.
