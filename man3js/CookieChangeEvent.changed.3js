Cookies will only be sent in a first\-party context and not be sent with
requests initiated by third party websites.
.TP
\f[B]\[dq]lax\[dq]\f[R]
Cookies are not sent on normal cross\-site subrequests (for example to
load images or frames into a third party site), but are sent when a user
is navigating within the origin site (i.e.\ when following a link).
.TP
\f[B]\[dq]none\[dq]\f[R]
Cookies will be sent in all contexts.
.RE
.TP
\f[B]partitioned\f[R]
A boolean indicating whether the cookie is a partitioned cookie
(\f[CR]true\f[R]) or not (\f[CR]false\f[R]).
See Cookies Having Independent Partitioned State (CHIPS) for more
information.
.SH EXAMPLES
In this example, when the cookie is set, the event listener logs the
\f[CR]changed\f[R] property to the console.
The first item in that array contains an object representing the cookie
that has just been set.
.IP
.EX
cookieStore.addEventListener(\[dq]change\[dq], (event) \f[B]=>\f[R] {
  console.log(event.changed[0]);
});

\f[B]const\f[R] one_day = 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000;
cookieStore.set({
  name: \[dq]cookie1\[dq],
  value: \[dq]cookie1\-value\[dq],
  expires: Date.now() + one_day,
