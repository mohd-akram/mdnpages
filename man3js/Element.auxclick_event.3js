.SH NAME
Element.auxclick_event \- Element: auxclick event
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]auxclick\f[B]\f[R] event is fired at an
\f[CR]Element\f[R] when a non\-primary pointing device button (any mouse
button other than the primary\[em]usually leftmost\[em]button) has been
pressed and released both within the same element.
.PP
\f[CR]auxclick\f[R] is fired after the \f[CR]mousedown\f[R] and
\f[CR]mouseup\f[R] events have been fired, in that order.
.SH SYNTAX
Use the event name in methods like \f[CR]addEventListener()\f[R], or set
an event handler property.
.IP
.EX
addEventListener(\[dq]auxclick\[dq], (event) => {});

.EE
.SH EVENT TYPE
A \f[CR]PointerEvent\f[R].
Inherits from \f[CR]MouseEvent\f[R].
.RS
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R] In earlier versions of the specification the event type
for this event was a \f[CR]MouseEvent\f[R], and this is still the type
passed in Firefox and Safari.

.SH EVENT PROPERTIES
\f[I]This interface inherits properties from \f[CI]MouseEvent\f[I] and
\f[CI]Event\f[I].\f[R]
.TP
\f[B]PointerEvent.altitudeAngle\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R] \f[I](experimental)\f[R]
Represents the angle between a transducer (a pointer or stylus) axis and
the X\-Y plane of a device screen.
.TP
\f[B]PointerEvent.azimuthAngle\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R] \f[I](experimental)\f[R]
Represents the angle between the Y\-Z plane and the plane containing
both the transducer (a pointer or stylus) axis and the Y axis.
.TP
\f[B]PointerEvent.pointerId\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
A unique identifier for the pointer causing the event.
.TP
\f[B]PointerEvent.width\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
The width (magnitude on the X axis), in CSS pixels, of the contact
geometry of the pointer.
.TP
\f[B]PointerEvent.height\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
The height (magnitude on the Y axis), in CSS pixels, of the contact
geometry of the pointer.
.TP
\f[B]PointerEvent.pressure\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
The normalized pressure of the pointer input in the range \f[CR]0\f[R]
to \f[CR]1\f[R], where \f[CR]0\f[R] and \f[CR]1\f[R] represent the
minimum and maximum pressure the hardware is capable of detecting,
respectively.
.TP
\f[B]PointerEvent.tangentialPressure\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
The normalized tangential pressure of the pointer input (also known as
barrel pressure or \c
.UR https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylinder_stress
cylinder stress
.UE \c
) in the range \f[CR]\-1\f[R] to \f[CR]1\f[R], where \f[CR]0\f[R] is the
neutral position of the control.
.TP
\f[B]PointerEvent.tiltX\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
The plane angle (in degrees, in the range of \f[CR]\-90\f[R] to
\f[CR]90\f[R]) between the Y\[en]Z plane and the plane containing both
the pointer (e.g.\ pen stylus) axis and the Y axis.
.TP
\f[B]PointerEvent.tiltY\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
The plane angle (in degrees, in the range of \f[CR]\-90\f[R] to
\f[CR]90\f[R]) between the X\[en]Z plane and the plane containing both
the pointer (e.g.\ pen stylus) axis and the X axis.
.TP
\f[B]PointerEvent.twist\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
The clockwise rotation of the pointer (e.g.\ pen stylus) around its
major axis in degrees, with a value in the range \f[CR]0\f[R] to
\f[CR]359\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]PointerEvent.pointerType\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
Indicates the device type that caused the event (mouse, pen, touch,
etc.).
.TP
\f[B]PointerEvent.isPrimary\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
Indicates if the pointer represents the primary pointer of this pointer
type.
.SH PREVENTING DEFAULT ACTIONS
For the vast majority of browsers that map middle click to opening a
link in a new tab, including Firefox, it is possible to cancel this
behavior by calling \f[CR]preventDefault()\f[R] from within an
\f[CR]auxclick\f[R] event handler.
.PP
When listening for \f[CR]auxclick\f[R] events originating on elements
that do not support input or navigation, you will often want to
explicitly prevent other default actions mapped to the down action of
the middle mouse button.
On Windows this is usually autoscroll, and on macOS and Linux this is
usually clipboard paste.
This can be done by preventing the default behavior of the
\f[CR]mousedown\f[R] or \f[CR]pointerdown\f[R] event.
.PP
Additionally, you may need to avoid opening a system context menu after
a right click.
Due to timing differences between operating systems, this too is not a
preventable default behavior of \f[CR]auxclick\f[R].
Instead, this can be done by preventing the default behavior of the
\f[CR]contextmenu\f[R] event.
.SH EXAMPLES
In this example we define functions for two event handlers \[em]
\f[CR]onclick\f[R] and \f[CR]onauxclick\f[R].
The former changes the color of the button background, while the latter
changes the button foreground (text) color.
You also can see the two functions in action by trying the demo out with
a multi\-button mouse (\c

; also \c

).
.SS JavaScript

.EX
let button = document.querySelector(\[dq]button\[dq]);
let html = document.querySelector(\[dq]html\[dq]);

function random(number) {
  return Math.floor(Math.random() * number);
}

function randomColor() {
  return \[ga]rgb(${random(255)}, ${random(255)}, ${random(255)})\[ga];
}

button.onclick = () => {
  button.style.backgroundColor = randomColor();
};

button.onauxclick = (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  button.style.color = randomColor();
};

button.oncontextmenu = (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
};
.EE
.PP
Notice that in addition to capturing the \f[CR]auxclick\f[R] event using
\f[CR]onauxclick\f[R], the \f[CR]contextmenu\f[R] event is also
captured, and \f[CR]preventDefault()\f[R] called on that event, in order
to prevent the context menu from popping up after the color change is
applied.

\f[B]Note:\f[R] If you are using a three\-button mouse, you\[cq]ll
notice that the \f[CR]onauxclick\f[R] handler is run when any of the
non\-left mouse buttons are clicked (usually including any
\[lq]special\[rq] buttons on gaming mice).
