.SH NAME
Error.cause \- Error: cause
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]cause\f[B]\f[R] data property of an \f[CR]Error\f[R]
instance indicates the specific original cause of the error.
.PP
It is used when catching and re\-throwing an error with a more\-specific
or useful error message in order to still have access to the original
error.
.SH VALUE
The value that was passed to the \f[CR]Error()\f[R] constructor in the
\f[CR]options.cause\f[R] argument.
It may not be present.

.SH DESCRIPTION
The value of \f[CR]cause\f[R] can be of any type.
You should not make assumptions that the error you caught has an
\f[CR]Error\f[R] as its \f[CR]cause\f[R], in the same way that you
cannot be sure the variable bound in the \f[CR]catch\f[R] statement is
an \f[CR]Error\f[R] either.
The \[lq]Providing structured data as the error cause\[rq] example below
shows a case where a non\-error is deliberately provided as the cause.
.SH EXAMPLES
.SS Rethrowing an error with a cause
It is sometimes useful to catch an error and re\-throw it with a new
message.
In this case you should pass the original error into the constructor for
the new \f[CR]Error\f[R], as shown.

.EX
try {
  connectToDatabase();
} catch (err) {
  throw new Error(\[dq]Connecting to database failed.\[dq], { cause: err });
}

For a more detailed example see Error > Differentiate between similar
errors.
.SS Providing structured data as the error cause
Error messages written for human consumption may be inappropriate for
machine parsing \[em] since they\[cq]re subject to rewording or
punctuation changes that may break any existing parsing written to
consume them.
So when throwing an error from a function, as an alternative to a
human\-readable error message, you can instead provide the cause as
structured data, for machine parsing.

.EX
function makeRSA(p, q) {
  if (!Number.isInteger(p) || !Number.isInteger(q)) {
    throw new Error(\[dq]RSA key generation requires integer inputs.\[dq], {
      cause: { code: \[dq]NonInteger\[dq], values: [p, q] },
    });
  }
  if (!areCoprime(p, q)) {
    throw new Error(\[dq]RSA key generation requires two co\-prime integers.\[dq], {
      cause: { code: \[dq]NonCoprime\[dq], values: [p, q] },
    });
  }
