The \f[B]\f[CB]totalRoundTripTime\f[B]\f[R] property of the
\f[CR]RTCIceCandidatePairStats\f[R] dictionary indicates the total time
that has elapsed between sending STUN requests and receiving the
responses, for all such requests that have been made so far on the pair
of candidates described by this \f[CR]RTCIceCandidatePairStats\f[R]
object.

.SH VALUE
This real number indicates the total number of seconds which have
elapsed between sending out STUN connectivity and consent check requests
and receiving their responses, for all such requests made so far on the
