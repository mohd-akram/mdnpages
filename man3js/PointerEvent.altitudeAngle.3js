.SH NAME
PointerEvent.altitudeAngle \- PointerEvent: altitudeAngle property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]altitudeAngle\f[B]\f[R] read\-only property of the
\f[CR]PointerEvent\f[R] interface represents the angle between a
transducer (a pointer or stylus) axis and the X\-Y plane of a device
screen.
The altitude angle describes whether the transducer is perpendicular to
the screen, parallel, or at some angle in between.
.PP
Depending on the specific hardware and platform, user agents will likely
only receive one set of values for the transducer orientation relative
to the screen plane \(em either \f[CR]tiltX\f[R] and \f[CR]tiltY\f[R] or
\f[CR]altitudeAngle\f[R] and \f[CR]azimuthAngle\f[R].

.SH VALUE
An angle in radians between \f[CR]0\f[R] and \f[CR]π/2\f[R] where
\f[CR]0\f[R] is parallel to the device surface (X\-Y plane), and
\f[CR]π/2\f[R] is perpendicular to the surface.
Defaults to \f[CR]π/2\f[R] (perpendicular to the surface) which differs
from the \c
.UR https://w3c.github.io/touch-events/#dom-touch-altitudeangle
\f[CR]altitudeAngle\f[R] in touch events
.UE \c
\ which defaults to \f[CR]0\f[R] (parallel to the surface).
For hardware and platforms that do not report tilt or angle, the value
is \f[CR]π/2\f[R].
