.SH NAME
DragEvent \- DragEvent
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]DragEvent\f[B]\f[R] interface is a \f[CR]DOM event\f[R]
that represents a drag and drop interaction.
The user initiates a drag by placing a pointer device (such as a mouse)
on the touch surface and then dragging the pointer to a new location
(such as another DOM element).
Applications are free to interpret a drag and drop interaction in an
application\-specific way.
.PP
This interface inherits properties from \f[CR]MouseEvent\f[R] and
\f[CR]Event\f[R].
.SH INSTANCE PROPERTIES
.TP
\f[B]DragEvent.dataTransfer\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
The data that is transferred during a drag and drop interaction.
.SH CONSTRUCTORS
Although this interface has a constructor, it is not possible to create
a useful DataTransfer object from script, since \f[CR]DataTransfer\f[R]
objects have a processing and security model that is coordinated by the
browser during drag\-and\-drops.
.TP
\f[B]DragEvent()\f[R]
Creates a synthetic and untrusted DragEvent.
.SH EVENT TYPES
.TP
\f[B]drag\f[R]
This event is fired when an element or text selection is being dragged.
.TP
\f[B]dragend\f[R]
This event is fired when a drag operation is being ended (by releasing a
mouse button or hitting the escape key).
.TP
\f[B]dragenter\f[R]
This event is fired when a dragged element or text selection enters a
valid drop target.
.TP
\f[B]dragleave\f[R]
This event is fired when a dragged element or text selection leaves a
valid drop target.
.TP
\f[B]dragover\f[R]
This event is fired continuously when an element or text selection is
being dragged and the mouse pointer is over a valid drop target (every
50 ms WHEN mouse is not moving ELSE much faster between 5 ms (slow
movement) and 1ms (fast movement) approximately.
This firing pattern is different than \f[CR]mouseover\f[R] ).
.TP
\f[B]dragstart\f[R]
This event is fired when the user starts dragging an element or text
selection.
.TP
\f[B]drop\f[R]
This event is fired when an element or text selection is dropped on a
valid drop target.

An Example of each property, constructor, event type and global event
handlers is included in their respective reference page.
