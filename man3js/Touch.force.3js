.SH NAME
Touch.force \- Touch: force property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]Touch.force\f[B]\f[R] read\-only property returns the
amount of pressure the user is applying to the touch surface for a
\f[CR]Touch\f[R] point.
.SH VALUE
A \f[CR]float\f[R] that represents the amount of pressure the user is
applying to the touch surface.
This is a value between \f[CR]0.0\f[R] (no pressure) and \f[CR]1.0\f[R]
(the maximum amount of pressure the hardware can recognize).
A value of \f[CR]0.0\f[R] is returned if no value is known (for example
the touch device does not support this property).
In environments where force is known, the absolute pressure represented
by the force attribute, and the sensitivity in levels of pressure, may
vary.
.SH EXAMPLES
This example illustrates using the \f[CR]Touch\f[R] interface\[cq]s
\f[CR]Touch.force\f[R] property.
This property is a relative value of pressure applied, in the range
\f[CR]0.0\f[R] to \f[CR]1.0\f[R], where \f[CR]0.0\f[R] is no pressure,
and \f[CR]1.0\f[R] is the highest level of pressure the touch device is
capable of sensing.
.PP
In following code snippet, the \f[CR]touchstart\f[R] event handler
iterates through the \f[CR]targetTouches\f[R] list and logs the
\f[CR]force\f[R] value of each touch point but the code could invoke
different processing depending on the value.

someElement.addEventListener(
  \[dq]touchstart\[dq],
  (e) \f[B]=>\f[R] {
    \f[I]// Iterate through the list of touch points and log each touch\f[R]
    \f[I]// point\[aq]s force.\f[R]
    \f[B]for\f[R] (\f[B]let\f[R] i = 0; i < e.targetTouches.length; i++) {
      \f[I]// Add code to \[dq]switch\[dq] based on the force value. For example\f[R]
      \f[I]// minimum pressure vs. maximum pressure could result in\f[R]
      \f[I]// different handling of the user\[aq]s input.\f[R]
      console.log(\[ga]targetTouches[${i}].force = ${e.targetTouches[i].force}\[ga]);
    }
