.SH NAME
RTCRtpStreamStats.ssrc \- RTCRtpStreamStats: ssrc property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[CR]RTCRtpStreamStats\f[R] dictionary\[cq]s
\f[B]\f[CB]ssrc\f[B]\f[R] property provides the Synchronization Source
(SSRC), an integer which uniquely identifies the source of the RTP
packets whose statistics are covered by the \f[CR]RTCStatsReport\f[R]
that includes this \f[CR]RTCRtpStreamStats\f[R] dictionary.
.SH VALUE
The Synchronization Source (SSRC) is a 32\-bit integer uniquely
identifying the source of the RTP packets whose statistics are covered
by the \f[CR]RTCStatsReport\f[R] object of which this
\f[CR]RTCRtpStreamStats\f[R] object is a component.
.PP
The manner in which these values are generated is not mandated by the
specification, although it does make recommendations.
You should not make any assumptions based on the value of
\f[CR]ssrc\f[R] other than that any two objects with the same
\f[CR]ssrc\f[R] value refer to the same source.
See RFC 3550, section 8) for additional information about
\f[CR]ssrc\f[R].

.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R] The specification includes an example that generates
values for \f[CR]ssrc\f[R] using MD5.
While not part of the standard, exactly, it is a good mechanism that may
be used by some browsers; others may use other methods, such as random
number generators.
\f[I]Do not\f[R] rely upon these values meaning anything other than
\[lq]these objects are associated with the same source.\[rq]
