.SH NAME
DeviceMotionEvent.acceleration \- DeviceMotionEvent: acceleration
property
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f[B]Secure context\f[R]: This feature is available only in secure
contexts (HTTPS).
.PP
The \f[B]\f[CB]acceleration\f[B]\f[R] read\-only property of the
\f[CR]DeviceMotionEvent\f[R] interface returns the amount of
acceleration recorded by the device, in \c
.UR https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meter_per_second_squared
meters per second squared (m/sÂ²)
.UE \c
\&.
The acceleration value does not include the effect of the gravity force,
in contrast to
\f[CR]DeviceMotionEvent.accelerationIncludingGravity\f[R].
.RS
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R] If the hardware doesn\[cq]t know how to remove gravity
from the acceleration data, this value may not be present in the
\f[CR]DeviceMotionEvent\f[R].
In this situation, you\[cq]ll need to use
\f[CR]DeviceMotionEvent.accelerationIncludingGravity\f[R] instead.
.RE
.SH VALUE
The \f[CR]acceleration\f[R] property is an object providing information
about acceleration on three axis.
Each axis is represented with its own property:
.TP
\f[B]x\f[R]
Represents the acceleration upon the x axis which is the west to east
axis
.TP
\f[B]y\f[R]
Represents the acceleration upon the y axis which is the south to north
axis
.TP
\f[B]z\f[R]
Represents the acceleration upon the z axis which is the down to up axis
