.SH NAME
Window.scrollY \- Window: scrollY property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The read\-only \f[B]\f[CB]scrollY\f[B]\f[R] property of the
\f[CR]Window\f[R] interface returns the number of pixels by which the
document is currently scrolled vertically.
This value is subpixel precise in modern browsers, meaning that it
isn\[cq]t necessarily a whole number.
You can get the number of pixels the document is scrolled horizontally
from the \f[CR]scrollX\f[R] property.
.SH VALUE
A double\-precision floating\-point value indicating the number of
pixels by which the document is currently scrolled vertically from the
origin, where a positive value means the content is scrolled down (to
reveal more content to the bottom).
In more technical terms, \f[CR]scrollY\f[R] returns the Y coordinate of
the top edge of the current viewport.
If the document isn\[cq]t scrolled at all top or down, then
\f[CR]scrollY\f[R] is 0.
If there is no viewport, the returned value is 0.
If the document is rendered on a subpixel\-precise device, then the
returned value is also subpixel\-precise and may contain a decimal
component.
.RS
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R] If you need an integer value, you can use
\f[CR]Math.round()\f[R] to round it off.
.RE
.PP
Safari responds to overscrolling by updating \f[CR]scrollY\f[R] beyond
the maximum scroll position (unless the default \[lq]bounce\[rq] effect
is disabled, such as by setting \f[CR]overscroll\-behavior\f[R] to
\f[CR]none\f[R]), while Chrome and Firefox do not.
For example, \f[CR]scrollY\f[R] may be negative on Safari just by
continuing to scroll up when the document is already at the top.
.PP
This property is read\-only.
To scroll the window to a particular place, use
\f[CR]Window.scroll()\f[R].
.SH EXAMPLES
.IP
.EX
\f[I]// make sure and go down to the second page\f[R]
\f[B]if\f[R] (window.scrollY) {
  window.scroll(0, 0); \f[I]// reset the scroll position to the top left of the document.\f[R]
}

window.scrollByPages(1);
.EE
.SH NOTES
Use this property to check that the document hasn\[cq]t already been
scrolled when using relative scroll functions such as
\f[CR]scrollBy()\f[R], \f[CR]scrollByLines()\f[R], or
\f[CR]scrollByPages()\f[R].
.PP
The \f[CR]pageYOffset\f[R] property is an alias for the
\f[CR]scrollY\f[R] property.
This means if you haven\[cq]t re\-assigned either property,
\f[CR]window.pageYOffset === window.scrollY\f[R] is always true.
