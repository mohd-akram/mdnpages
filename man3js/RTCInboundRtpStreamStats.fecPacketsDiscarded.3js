.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]fecPacketsDiscarded\f[B]\f[R] property of the
\f[CR]RTCInboundRtpStreamStats\f[R] dictionary is a numeric value
indicating the number of RTP Forward Error Correction (FEC) packets that
have been discarded.
.SH VALUE
An unsigned integer value indicating how many FEC packets have been
received whose error correction payload has been discarded.
.PP
This can happen if all the packets covered by the FEC packet have
already been received or recovered using another FEC packet, or if the
FEC packet arrived outside the recovery window and the lost RTP packets
have already been skipped during playback as a result.
The value of \f[CR]fecPacketsReceived\f[R] includes these discarded
packets.
