.SH NAME
MediaTrackSupportedConstraints \- MediaTrackSupportedConstraints
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]MediaTrackSupportedConstraints\f[B]\f[R] dictionary
establishes the list of constrainable properties recognized by the user
agent or browser in its implementation of the
\f[CR]MediaStreamTrack\f[R] object.
An object conforming to \f[CR]MediaTrackSupportedConstraints\f[R] is
returned by \f[CR]MediaDevices.getSupportedConstraints()\f[R].
.PP
Because of the way interface definitions in WebIDL work, if a constraint
is requested but not supported, no error will occur.
Instead, the specified constraints will be applied, with any
unrecognized constraints stripped from the request.
That can lead to confusing and hard to debug errors, so be sure to use
\f[CR]getSupportedConstraints()\f[R] to retrieve this information before
attempting to establish constraints if you need to know the difference
between silently ignoring a constraint and a constraint being accepted.
.PP
An actual constraint set is described using an object based on the
\f[CR]MediaTrackConstraints\f[R] dictionary.
.PP
To learn more about how constraints work, see Capabilities, constraints,
and settings.
.SH INSTANCE PROPERTIES
Some combination\[em]but not necessarily all\[em]of the following
properties will exist on the object.
