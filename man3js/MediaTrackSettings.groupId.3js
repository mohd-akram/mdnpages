.SH NAME
MediaTrackSettings.groupId \- MediaTrackSettings: groupId property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[CR]MediaTrackSettings\f[R] dictionary\(cqs
\f[B]\f[CB]groupId\f[B]\f[R] property is a browsing\-session unique
string which identifies the group of devices which includes the source
for the \f[CR]MediaStreamTrack\f[R].
This lets you determine what value was selected to comply with your
specified constraints for this property\(cqs value as described in the
\f[CR]MediaTrackConstraints.groupId\f[R] property you provided when
calling either \f[CR]getUserMedia()\f[R].
.PP
If needed, you can determine whether or not this constraint is supported
by checking the value of
\f[CR]MediaTrackSupportedConstraints.groupId\f[R] as returned by a call
to \f[CR]MediaDevices.getSupportedConstraints()\f[R].
However, typically this is unnecessary since browsers will ignore any
constraints they\(cqre unfamiliar with.
.PP
Because RTP doesn\(cqt include this information, tracks associated with
a WebRTC \f[CR]RTCPeerConnection\f[R] will never include this property.
.SH VALUE
A string whose value is a browsing\-session unique identifier for a
group of devices which includes the source of the track\(cqs contents.
Two devices share the same group ID if they belong to the same physical
hardware device.
For example, a headset has two devices on it: a microphone which can
serve as a source for audio tracks and a speaker which can serve as an
output for audio.
.PP
The group ID is not usable across multiple browsing sessions.
However, it can be used to ensure that audio input and output are both
being performed on the same headset, for example, or to ensure that the
built\-in camera and microphone on a phone are being used for video
conferencing purposes.
.PP
The actual value of the string, however, is determined by the source of
the track, and there is no guarantee what form it will take, although
the specification does recommend it be a GUID.
.PP
Since this property isn\(cqt stable across browsing sessions, its
usefulness when calling \f[CR]getUserMedia()\f[R] is generally limited
to ensuring that tasks performed during the same browsing session use
devices from the same group (or that they don\(cqt use devices from the
same group).
There is no situation in which the groupId is useful when calling
\f[CR]applyConstraints()\f[R], since the value can\(cqt be changed.
