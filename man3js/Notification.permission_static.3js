property
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f[B]Secure context:\f[R] This feature is available only in secure
contexts (HTTPS).
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R] This feature is available in Web Workers.
.PP
The \f[B]\f[CB]permission\f[B]\f[R] read\-only static property of the
\f[CR]Notification\f[R] interface indicates the current permission
granted by the user for the current origin to display web notifications.
.SH VALUE
A string representing the current permission.
The value can be:
.TP
\f[B]granted\f[R]
The user has explicitly granted permission for the current origin to
display system notifications.
.TP
\f[B]denied\f[R]
The user has explicitly denied permission for the current origin to
display system notifications.
.TP
\f[B]default\f[R]
The user decision is unknown; in this case the application will act as
if permission was \f[CR]denied\f[R].
.SH EXAMPLES
The following snippet could be used if you wanted to first check whether
notifications are supported, then check if permission has been granted
for the current origin to send notifications, then request permission if
required, before then sending a notification.
