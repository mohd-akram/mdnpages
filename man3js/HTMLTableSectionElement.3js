.SH NAME
HTMLTableSectionElement \- HTMLTableSectionElement
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]HTMLTableSectionElement\f[B]\f[R] interface provides
special properties and methods (beyond the \f[CR]HTMLElement\f[R]
interface it also has available to it by inheritance) for manipulating
the layout and presentation of sections, that is headers, footers and
bodies (\f[CR]<thead>\f[R], \f[CR]<tfoot>\f[R], and \f[CR]<tbody>\f[R],
respectively) in an HTML table.
.SH INSTANCE PROPERTIES
\f[I]Inherits properties from its parent, \f[CI]HTMLElement\f[I].\f[R]
.TP
\f[B]HTMLTableSectionElement.align\f[R] \f[I](deprecated)\f[R]
A string containing an enumerated value reflecting the \f[CR]align\f[R]
attribute.
It indicates the alignment of the element\[cq]s contents with respect to
the surrounding context.
The possible values are \f[CR]\[dq]left\[dq]\f[R],
\f[CR]\[dq]right\[dq]\f[R], and \f[CR]\[dq]center\[dq]\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]HTMLTableSectionElement.rows\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
Returns a live \f[CR]HTMLCollection\f[R] containing the rows in the
section.
The \f[CR]HTMLCollection\f[R] is live and is automatically updated when
rows are added or removed.
.TP
\f[B]HTMLTableSectionElement.ch\f[R] \f[I](deprecated)\f[R]
A string containing one single character.
This character is the one to align all the cell of a column on.
It reflects the \f[CR]char\f[R] and default to the decimal points
associated with the language, e.g.\ \f[CR]\[aq].\[aq]\f[R] for English,
or \f[CR]\[aq],\[aq]\f[R] for French.
This property was optional and was not very well supported.
.TP
\f[B]HTMLTableSectionElement.chOff\f[R] \f[I](deprecated)\f[R]
A string containing an integer indicating how many characters must be
left at the right (for left\-to\-right scripts; or at the left for
right\-to\-left scripts) of the character defined by
\f[CR]HTMLTableRowElement.ch\f[R].
This property was optional and was not very well supported.
.TP
\f[B]HTMLTableSectionElement.vAlign\f[R] \f[I](deprecated)\f[R]
A string representing an enumerated value indicating how the content of
the cell must be vertically aligned.
It reflects the \f[CR]valign\f[R] attribute and can have one of the
following values: \f[CR]\[dq]top\[dq]\f[R], \f[CR]\[dq]middle\[dq]\f[R],
\f[CR]\[dq]bottom\[dq]\f[R], or \f[CR]\[dq]baseline\[dq]\f[R].
.SH INSTANCE METHODS
\f[I]Inherits methods from its parent, \f[CI]HTMLElement\f[I]\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]HTMLTableSectionElement.deleteRow()\f[R]
Removes the row, corresponding to the \f[CR]index\f[R] given in
parameter, in the section.
If the \f[CR]index\f[R] value is \f[CR]\-1\f[R] the last row is removed;
if it smaller than \f[CR]\-1\f[R] or greater than the amount of rows in
the collection, a \f[CR]DOMException\f[R] with the value
\f[CR]IndexSizeError\f[R] is raised.
.TP
\f[B]HTMLTableSectionElement.insertRow()\f[R]
Returns an \f[CR]HTMLTableRowElement\f[R] representing a new row of the
section.
It inserts it in the rows collection immediately before the
\f[CR]<tr>\f[R] element at the given \f[CR]index\f[R] position.
If the \f[CR]index\f[R] is \f[CR]\-1\f[R], the new row is appended to
the collection.
If the \f[CR]index\f[R] is smaller than \f[CR]\-1\f[R] or greater than
the number of rows in the collection, a \f[CR]DOMException\f[R] with the
value \f[CR]IndexSizeError\f[R] is raised.
