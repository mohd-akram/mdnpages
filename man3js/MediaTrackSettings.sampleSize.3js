.SH NAME
MediaTrackSettings.sampleSize \- MediaTrackSettings: sampleSize property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[CR]MediaTrackSettings\f[R] dictionary\[cq]s
\f[B]\f[CB]sampleSize\f[B]\f[R] property is an integer indicating the
linear sample size (in bits per sample) the \f[CR]MediaStreamTrack\f[R]
is currently configured for.
This lets you determine what value was selected to comply with your
specified constraints for this property\[cq]s value as described in the
\f[CR]MediaTrackConstraints.sampleSize\f[R] property you provided when
calling either \f[CR]getUserMedia()\f[R] or
\f[CR]MediaStreamTrack.applyConstraints()\f[R].
.PP
If needed, you can determine whether or not this constraint is supported
by checking the value of
\f[CR]MediaTrackSupportedConstraints.sampleSize\f[R] as returned by a
call to \f[CR]MediaDevices.getSupportedConstraints()\f[R].
However, typically this is unnecessary since browsers will ignore any
constraints they\[cq]re unfamiliar with.
.SH VALUE
An integer value indicating how many bits each audio sample is
represented by.
The most commonly used sample size for many years now is 16 bits per
sample, which was used for CD audio among others.
Other common sample sizes are 8 (for reduced bandwidth requirements) and
24 (for high\-resolution professional audio).
.PP
Each audio channel on the track requires sampleSize bits.
That means that a given sample actually uses (\f[CR]sampleSize\f[R] / 8)
* \f[CR]channelCount\f[R] bytes of data.
For example, 16\-bit stereo audio requires (16/8)*2 or 4 bytes per
sample.
