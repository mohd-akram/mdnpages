.SH NAME
Touch \- Touch
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]Touch\f[B]\f[R] interface represents a single contact
point on a touch\-sensitive device.
The contact point is commonly a finger or stylus and the device may be a
touchscreen or trackpad.
.PP
The \f[CR]Touch.radiusX\f[R], \f[CR]Touch.radiusY\f[R], and
\f[CR]Touch.rotationAngle\f[R] describe the area of contact between the
user and the screen, the \f[I]touch area\f[R].
This can be helpful when dealing with imprecise pointing devices such as
fingers.
These values are set to describe an ellipse that as closely as possible
matches the entire area of contact (such as the user\[cq]s fingertip).
.RS
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R] Many of the properties\[cq] values are
hardware\-dependent; for example, if the device doesn\[cq]t have a way
to detect the amount of pressure placed on the surface, the
\f[CR]force\f[R] value will always be 0.
This may also be the case for \f[CR]radiusX\f[R] and \f[CR]radiusY\f[R];
if the hardware reports only a single point, these values will be 1.
.RE
.SH CONSTRUCTOR
.TP
\f[B]Touch()\f[R]
Creates a Touch object.
.SH INSTANCE PROPERTIES
\f[I]This interface has no parent, and doesn\[cq]t inherit or implement
other properties.\f[R]
.SS Basic properties
.TP
\f[B]Touch.identifier\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
Returns a unique identifier for this \f[CR]Touch\f[R] object.
A given touch point (say, by a finger) will have the same identifier for
the duration of its movement around the surface.
This lets you ensure that you\[cq]re tracking the same touch all the
time.
.TP
\f[B]Touch.screenX\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
Returns the X coordinate of the touch point relative to the left edge of
the screen.
.TP
\f[B]Touch.screenY\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
Returns the Y coordinate of the touch point relative to the top edge of
the screen.
.TP
\f[B]Touch.clientX\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
Returns the X coordinate of the touch point relative to the left edge of
the browser viewport, not including any scroll offset.
.TP
\f[B]Touch.clientY\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
Returns the Y coordinate of the touch point relative to the top edge of
the browser viewport, not including any scroll offset.
.TP
\f[B]Touch.pageX\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
Returns the X coordinate of the touch point relative to the left edge of
the document.
Unlike \f[CR]clientX\f[R], this value includes the horizontal scroll
offset, if any.
.TP
\f[B]Touch.pageY\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
Returns the Y coordinate of the touch point relative to the top of the
document.
Unlike \f[CR]clientY\f[R], this value includes the vertical scroll
offset, if any.
.TP
\f[B]Touch.target\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
Returns the \f[CR]Element\f[R] on which the touch point started when it
was first placed on the surface, even if the touch point has since moved
outside the interactive area of that element or even been removed from
the document.
.SS Touch area
.TP
\f[B]Touch.radiusX\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
Returns the X radius of the ellipse that most closely circumscribes the
area of contact with the screen.
The value is in pixels of the same scale as \f[CR]screenX\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]Touch.radiusY\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
Returns the Y radius of the ellipse that most closely circumscribes the
area of contact with the screen.
The value is in pixels of the same scale as \f[CR]screenY\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]Touch.rotationAngle\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
Returns the angle (in degrees) that the ellipse described by radiusX and
radiusY must be rotated, clockwise, to most accurately cover the area of
contact between the user and the surface.
.TP
\f[B]Touch.force\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
Returns the amount of pressure being applied to the surface by the user,
as a \f[CR]float\f[R] between \f[CR]0.0\f[R] (no pressure) and
\f[CR]1.0\f[R] (maximum pressure).
