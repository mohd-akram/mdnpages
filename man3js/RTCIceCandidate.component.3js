.SH NAME
RTCIceCandidate.component \- RTCIceCandidate: component property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The read\-only \f[B]\f[CB]component\f[B]\f[R] property on the
\f[CR]RTCIceCandidate\f[R] interface is a string which indicates whether
the candidate is an RTP or an RTCP candidate.
.PP
If a candidate represents both RTP and RTCP multiplexed together, it is
reported as an RTP candidate.
.SH VALUE
A string which is one of the following:
.TP
\f[B]rtp\f[R]
Identifies an ICE transport which is being used for the Real\-time
Transport Protocol (RTP), or for RTP multiplexed with the RTP Control
Protocol (RTCP).
RTP is defined in RFC 3550.
This value corresponds to the component ID field in the
\f[CR]candidate\f[R] a\-line with the value 1.
.TP
\f[B]rtcp\f[R]
Identifies an ICE transport being used for RTCP, which is defined in RFC
3550, section 6.
This value corresponds to the component ID 2.
.SH USAGE NOTES
Consider this SDP attribute line (a\-line):
.IP
.EX
a=candidate:4234997325 1 udp 2043278322 192.0.2.172 44323 typ host
.EE
.PP
This is an ICE candidate a\-line, whose \f[CR]foundation\f[R] is
4234997325.
The next field on the a\-line, \f[CR]\[dq]1\[dq]\f[R], is the component
ID.
A value of \f[CR]\[dq]1\[dq]\f[R] indicates RTP, which is recorded in
the \f[CR]component\f[R] property as \f[CR]\[dq]rtp\[dq]\f[R].
If this value were instead \f[CR]\[dq]2\[dq]\f[R], the a\-line would be
describing an RTCP candidate, and \f[CR]component\f[R] would be
\f[CR]\[dq]rtcp\[dq]\f[R].
.SH EXAMPLES
This code snippet examines a candidate\[cq]s component type and
dispatches the candidate to different handlers depending on the value.
.IP
.EX
\f[B]if\f[R] (candidate.component === \[dq]rtp\[dq]) {
  handleRTPCandidate(candidate);
} \f[B]else\f[R] \f[B]if\f[R] (candidate.component === \[dq]rtcp\[dq]) {
  handleRTCPCandidate(candidate);
} \f[B]else\f[R] {
  handleUnknownCandidate(candidate);
}
