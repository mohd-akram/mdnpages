.SH NAME
RTCInboundRtpStreamStats.fecPacketsReceived \- RTCInboundRtpStreamStats:
fecPacketsReceived property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]fecPacketsReceived\f[B]\f[R] property of the
\f[CR]RTCInboundRtpStreamStats\f[R] dictionary indicates how many
Forward Error Correction (FEC) packets have been received by this RTP
receiver from the remote peer.
.PP
An FEC packet provides parity information which can be used to attempt
to reconstruct RTP data packets which have been corrupted in transit.
.SH VALUE
An unsigned integer value which indicates the total number of FEC
packets which have been received from the remote peer during this RTP
session.
Forward Error Correction uses an exclusive\-or method to perform parity
checks on the received data.
.PP
By using the FEC parity information to attempt to reconstruct damaged
packets, it is possible to avoid the need to retransmit damaged packets,
which in turn helps to reduce lag, or the need to skip damaged frames
entirely.
.RS
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R] This counter may also be incremented when FEC packets
arrive in\-band along with media content; this can happen with Opus, for
example.
.RE
.SH USAGE NOTES
It\[cq]s possible that a subset of the FEC packets which have been
received were discarded instead of being used.
This can happen if the packets covered by the FEC packets have already
been received successfully or have already been reconstructed using a
previously\-received FEC packet.
This may also happen if the FEC packet arrives outside the window of
time in which the client will attempt to use it.
.PP
If you wish to know how many of the received packets were discarded, you
can examine the value of \f[CR]fecPacketsDiscarded\f[R].
