.SH NAME
RTCIceCandidatePairStats.availableOutgoingBitrate \-
RTCIceCandidatePairStats: availableOutgoingBitrate property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]availableOutgoingBitrate\f[B]\f[R] property of the
\f[CR]RTCIceCandidatePairStats\f[R] dictionary indicates the available
outbound capacity of the network connection represented by the candidate
pair.
The higher the value, the more bandwidth you can assume is available for
outgoing data.
.PP
You can get the incoming available bitrate from
\f[CR]availableIncomingBitrate\f[R].
.SH VALUE
A number which approximates the amount of available bandwidth for
outgoing data on the network connection described by the
\f[CR]RTCIceCandidatePair\f[R].
The value is reported in bits per second and is computed over a
1\-second interval.
.PP
The returned value is \f[CR]undefined\f[R] in each of the following
situations:
.IP \(bu 2
The underlying implementation doesn\(cqt support computing a
sender\-side estimate of the outgoing bit rate.
.IP \(bu 2
The \f[CR]RTCIceCandidatePair\f[R] described by this object has never
been used.
.IP \(bu 2
The candidate pair was once in use, but no longer is.
.PP
The value returned is calculated by adding up the available bit rate for
every RTP stream using the connection described by this candidate pair.
The returned value doesn\(cqt take into account overhead introduced by
underlying protocols, including IP, UDP, or TCP.
.RS
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R] The returned value is computed using a method
similar\(embut not identical\(emto the Transport Independent Application
Specific Maximum (TIAS) described in RFC 3890, section 6.2).
