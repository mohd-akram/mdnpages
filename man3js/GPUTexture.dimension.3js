.SH NAME
GPUTexture.dimension \- GPUTexture: dimension property
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f[B]Secure context:\f[R] This feature is available only in secure
contexts (HTTPS).
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R] This feature is available in Web Workers.
.PP
The \f[B]\f[CB]dimension\f[B]\f[R] read\-only property of the
\f[CR]GPUTexture\f[R] interface represents the dimension of the set of
texels for each \f[CR]GPUTexture\f[R] subresource.
.PP
This is set via the \f[CR]dimension\f[R] property in the descriptor
object passed into the originating \f[CR]GPUDevice.createTexture()\f[R]
call, which defaults to \f[CR]\(dq2d\(dq\f[R] if omitted.
.SH VALUE
An enumerated value.
Possible values are:
.IP \(bu 2
\f[CR]\(dq1d\(dq\f[R]: A one\-dimensional texture with a single
dimension, width.
.IP \(bu 2
\f[CR]\(dq2d\(dq\f[R]: A two\-dimensional texture with a width and
height, which may also have layers.
Only \f[CR]\(dq2d\(dq\f[R] textures can have mipmaps, be multisampled,
use a compressed or depth/stencil format, and be used as a render
attachment.
.IP \(bu 2
\f[CR]\(dq3d\(dq\f[R]: A three\-dimensional texture with a width,
height, and depth.
.SH EXAMPLES
.IP
.EX
\f[I]// \&...\f[R]

\f[B]const\f[R] depthTexture = device.createTexture({
  size: [canvas.width, canvas.height],
  format: \(dqdepth24plus\(dq,
  usage: GPUTextureUsage.RENDER_ATTACHMENT,
});

console.log(depthTexture.dimension); \f[I]// \(dq2d\(dq\f[R]
