Request.credentials \- Request: credentials property
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f[B]Note:\f[R] This feature is available in Web Workers.
.PP
The \f[B]\f[CB]credentials\f[B]\f[R] read\-only property of the
\f[CR]Request\f[R] interface reflects the value given to the
\f[CR]Request()\f[R] constructor in the \f[CR]credentials\f[R] option.
It determines whether or not the browser sends credentials with the
request, as well as whether any \f[B]\f[CB]Set\-Cookie\f[B]\f[R]
response headers are respected.

Credentials are cookies, TLS client certificates, or authentication
headers containing a username and password.

.SH EXAMPLES
In the following snippet, we create a new request using the
\f[CR]Request()\f[R] constructor (for an image file in the same
directory as the script), then save the request credentials in a
variable:
.IP
.EX
\f[B]const\f[R] request = \f[B]new\f[R] Request(\[dq]flowers.jpg\[dq]);
\f[B]const\f[R] credentials = request.credentials; \f[I]// returns \[dq]same\-origin\[dq] by default\f[R]
