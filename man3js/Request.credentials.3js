.SH NAME
Request.credentials \- Request: credentials property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]credentials\f[B]\f[R] read\-only property of the
\f[CR]Request\f[R] interface indicates whether the user agent should
send or receive cookies from the other domain in the case of
cross\-origin requests.
.SH VALUE
A \f[CR]RequestCredentials\f[R] dictionary value indicating whether the
user agent should send or receive cookies from the other domain in the
case of cross\-origin requests.
Possible values are:
.TP
\f[B]omit\f[R]
Never send or receive cookies.
.TP
\f[B]same\-origin\f[R]
Send user credentials (cookies, basic http auth, etc..)
if the URL is on the same origin as the calling script.
\f[B]This is the default value.\f[R]
.TP
\f[B]include\f[R]
Always send user credentials (cookies, basic http auth, etc..), even for
cross\-origin calls.
.PP
This is similar to XHR\[cq]s \f[CR]withCredentials\f[R] flag, but with
three available values instead of two.
.SH EXAMPLES
In the following snippet, we create a new request using the
\f[CR]Request()\f[R] constructor (for an image file in the same
directory as the script), then save the request credentials in a
variable:
.IP
.EX
\f[B]const\f[R] myRequest = \f[B]new\f[R] Request(\[dq]flowers.jpg\[dq]);
\f[B]const\f[R] myCred = myRequest.credentials; \f[I]// returns \[dq]same\-origin\[dq] by default\f[R]
