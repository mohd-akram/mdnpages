.SH SYNOPSIS
\f[B]Secure context:\f[R] This feature is available only in secure
contexts (HTTPS).
.PP
The \f[B]\f[CB]AuthenticatorAssertionResponse\f[B]\f[R] interface of the
Web Authentication API contains a digital signature from the private key
of a particular WebAuthn credential.
The relying party\(cqs server can verify this signature to authenticate
a user, for example when they sign in.
.PP
An \f[CR]AuthenticatorAssertionResponse\f[R] object instance is
available in the \f[CR]response\f[R] property of a
\f[CR]PublicKeyCredential\f[R] object returned by a successful
\f[CR]navigator.credentials.get()\f[R] call.
.PP
This interface inherits from \f[CR]AuthenticatorResponse\f[R].
.RS
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R] This interface is restricted to top\-level contexts.

.SH INSTANCE PROPERTIES
\f[I]Also inherits properties from its parent,
\f[CI]AuthenticatorResponse\f[I].\f[R]
.TP
\f[B]AuthenticatorAssertionResponse.authenticatorData\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
An \f[CR]ArrayBuffer\f[R] containing information from the authenticator
such as the Relying Party ID Hash (rpIdHash), a signature counter, test
of user presence and user verification flags, and any extensions
processed by the authenticator.
.TP
\f[B]AuthenticatorResponse.clientDataJSON\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
Contains the JSON\-compatible serialization of the data passed from the
browser to the authenticator in order to authenticate with this
credential \(em i.e., when \f[CR]CredentialsContainer.get()\f[R] is
called with a \f[CR]publicKey\f[R] option.
This data contains some information from the options passed into the
\f[CR]get()\f[R] call, and some information controlled by the browser.
.TP
\f[B]AuthenticatorAssertionResponse.signature\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
An assertion signature over
\f[CR]AuthenticatorAssertionResponse.authenticatorData\f[R] and
\f[CR]AuthenticatorResponse.clientDataJSON\f[R].
The assertion signature is created with the private key of the key pair
that was created during the originating
\f[CR]navigator.credentials.create()\f[R] call and verified using the
public key of that same key pair.
.TP
\f[B]AuthenticatorAssertionResponse.userHandle\f[R] \f[I](read\-only)\f[R]
An \f[CR]ArrayBuffer\f[R] containing an opaque user identifier,
specified as \f[CR]user.id\f[R] in the options passed to the originating
\f[CR]navigator.credentials.create()\f[R] call.
.SH INSTANCE METHODS
None.
