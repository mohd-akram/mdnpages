.SH NAME
HTMLMediaElement.audioTracks \- HTMLMediaElement: audioTracks property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The read\-only \f[B]\f[CB]audioTracks\f[B]\f[R] property on
\f[CR]HTMLMediaElement\f[R] objects returns an \f[CR]AudioTrackList\f[R]
object listing all of the \f[CR]AudioTrack\f[R] objects representing the
media element\[cq]s audio tracks.
.PP
The media element may be either an \f[CR]<audio>\f[R] element or a
\f[CR]<video>\f[R] element.
.PP
The returned list is \f[I]live\f[R]; that is, as tracks are added to and
removed from the media element, the list\[cq]s contents change
dynamically.
Once you have a reference to the list, you can monitor it for changes to
detect when new audio tracks are added or existing ones removed.
See AudioTrackList events to learn more about watching for changes to a
media element\[cq]s track list.
.SH VALUE
An \f[CR]AudioTrackList\f[R] object representing the list of audio
tracks included in the media element.
The list of tracks can be accessed using array notation, or using the
object\[cq]s \f[CR]getTrackById()\f[R] method.
.PP
Each track is represented by an \f[CR]AudioTrack\f[R] object which
provides information about the track.
.SH EXAMPLES
In this example, all of the audio tracks on a given element are muted.
.SS HTML
The HTML establishes the element itself.
.IP
.EX
<\f[B]video\f[R] id=\[dq]video\[dq] src=\[dq]somevideo.mp4\[dq]></\f[B]video\f[R]>
.EE
.SS JavaScript
The JavaScript code handles muting the video element\[cq]s audio tracks.
.IP
.EX
\f[B]const\f[R] video = document.getElementById(\[dq]video\[dq]);

\f[B]for\f[R] (\f[B]let\f[R] i = 0; i < video.audioTracks.length; i += 1) {
