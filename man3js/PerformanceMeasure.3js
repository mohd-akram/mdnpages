PerformanceMeasure \- PerformanceMeasure
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f[B]Note:\f[R] This feature is available in Web Workers.
.PP
\f[B]\f[CB]PerformanceMeasure\f[B]\f[R] is an \f[I]abstract\f[R]
interface for \f[CR]PerformanceEntry\f[R] objects with an
\f[CR]entryType\f[R] of \f[CR]\[dq]measure\[dq]\f[R].
Entries of this type are created by calling
\f[CR]performance.measure()\f[R] to add a \f[I]named\f[R]
\f[CR]DOMHighResTimeStamp\f[R] (the \f[I]measure\f[R]) between two
\f[I]marks\f[R] to the browser\[cq]s \f[I]performance timeline\f[R].
.SH INSTANCE PROPERTIES
This interface defines:
.TP
\f[B]PerformanceMeasure.detail\f[R]
Contains arbitrary metadata about the measure.
.PP
In addition, it extends the following \f[CR]PerformanceEntry\f[R]
properties by qualifying/constraining the properties as follows:
.TP
\f[B]PerformanceEntry.entryType\f[R]
Returns \f[CR]\[dq]measure\[dq]\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]PerformanceEntry.name\f[R]
Returns the name given to the measure when it was created via a call to
\f[CR]performance.measure()\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]PerformanceEntry.startTime\f[R]
Returns a \f[CR]timestamp\f[R] given to the measure when
\f[CR]performance.measure()\f[R] was called.
.TP
\f[B]PerformanceEntry.duration\f[R]
Returns a \f[CR]DOMHighResTimeStamp\f[R] that is the duration of the
measure (typically, the measure\[cq]s end mark timestamp minus its start
mark timestamp).
.SH INSTANCE METHODS
This interface has no methods.
