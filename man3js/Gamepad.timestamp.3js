.SH NAME
Gamepad.timestamp \- Gamepad: timestamp property
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f[B]Secure context:\f[R] This feature is available only in secure
contexts (HTTPS).
.PP
The \f[B]\f[CB]Gamepad.timestamp\f[B]\f[R] property of the
\f[CR]Gamepad\f[R] interface returns a \f[CR]DOMHighResTimeStamp\f[R]
representing the last time the data for this gamepad was updated.
.PP
The idea behind this is to allow developers to determine if the
\f[CR]axes\f[R] and \f[CR]button\f[R] data have been updated from the
hardware.
The value must be relative to the \f[CR]navigationStart\f[R] attribute
of the \f[CR]PerformanceTiming\f[R] interface.
Values are monotonically increasing, meaning that they can be compared
to determine the ordering of updates, as newer values will always be
greater than or equal to older values.
