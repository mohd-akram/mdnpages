.SH NAME
PublicKeyCredential.authenticatorAttachment \- PublicKeyCredential:
authenticatorAttachment property
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f[B]Secure context:\f[R] This feature is available only in secure
contexts (HTTPS).
.PP
The \f[B]\f[CB]authenticatorAttachment\f[B]\f[R] read\-only property of
the \f[CR]PublicKeyCredential\f[R] interface is a string that indicates
the general category of authenticator used during the associated
\f[CR]navigator.credentials.create()\f[R] or
\f[CR]navigator.credentials.get()\f[R] call.
.SH VALUE
A string, which will be one of the following values:
.TP
\f[B]\(dqplatform\(dq\f[R]
The authenticator is part of the device WebAuthn is running on (termed a
\f[B]platform authenticator\f[R]), therefore WebAuthn will communicate
with it using a transport available to that platform, such as a
platform\-specific API.
A public key credential bound to a platform authenticator is called a
\f[B]platform credential\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]\(dqcross\-platform\(dq\f[R]
The authenticator is not a part of the device WebAuthn is running on
(termed a \f[B]roaming authenticator\f[R] as it can roam between
different devices), therefore WebAuthn will communicate with it using a
cross\-platform transport protocol such as Bluetooth or NFC.
A public key credential bound to a roaming authenticator is called a
\f[B]roaming credential\f[R].
