The \f[B]\f[CB]readyState\f[B]\f[R] read\-only property of the
\f[CR]FileReader\f[R] interface provides the current state of the
reading operation a \f[CR]FileReader\f[R] is in.
A \f[CR]FileReader\f[R] exists in one of the following states:

.TE
.TP
\f[B]EMPTY\f[R]
The \f[CR]FileReader\f[R] has been created, but no readAs method was
called yet.
.TP
\f[B]LOADING\f[R]
A readAs method was invoked.
A \f[CR]File\f[R] or \f[CR]Blob\f[R] is being read, and no error has
occurred yet.
.TP
\f[B]DONE\f[R]
The read operation is complete.
This could mean that: the entire \f[CR]File\f[R] or \f[CR]Blob\f[R] has
been read into memory, a file read error occurred, or \f[CR]abort()\f[R]
was called and the read was cancelled.

.EX
\f[B]const\f[R] reader = \f[B]new\f[R] FileReader();
console.log(\[dq]EMPTY\[dq], reader.readyState); \f[I]// readyState will be 0\f[R]

reader.readAsText(blob);
console.log(\[dq]LOADING\[dq], reader.readyState); \f[I]// readyState will be 1\f[R]

reader.onloadend = () \f[B]=>\f[R] {
  console.log(\[dq]DONE\[dq], reader.readyState); \f[I]// readyState will be 2\f[R]
};
