.SH NAME
EventTarget \- EventTarget
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]EventTarget\f[B]\f[R] interface is implemented by objects
that can receive events and may have listeners for them.
In other words, any target of events implements the three methods
associated with this interface.
.PP
\f[CR]Element\f[R], and its children, as well as \f[CR]Document\f[R] and
\f[CR]Window\f[R], are the most common event targets, but other objects
can be event targets, too.
For example \f[CR]IDBRequest\f[R], \f[CR]AudioNode\f[R], and
\f[CR]AudioContext\f[R] are also event targets.
.PP
Many event targets (including elements, documents, and windows) also
support setting event handlers via \f[CR]onevent\f[R] properties and
attributes.
.SH CONSTRUCTOR
