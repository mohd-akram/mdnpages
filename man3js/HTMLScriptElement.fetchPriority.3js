.SH NAME
HTMLScriptElement.fetchPriority \- HTMLScriptElement: fetchPriority
property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]fetchPriority\f[B]\f[R] property of the
\f[CR]HTMLScriptElement\f[R] interface represents a hint to the browser
indicating how it should prioritize fetching an external script relative
to other external scripts.
It reflects the \f[CR]fetchpriority\f[R] attribute of the
\f[CR]<script>\f[R] element.
.PP
The property allows a developer to signal that fetching a particular
script early or late in the loading process has more or less impact on
user experience than a browser can reasonably infer when assigning an
internal priority.
This in turn allows the browser to increase or decrease the priority,
and potentially load the script earlier or later than it would
otherwise.
The property should be used sparingly, as excessive or incorrect
prioritization can degrade performance.
.PP
The fetch priority allows you to decrease the priority of late\-body
scripts, or to increase the priority of \f[CR]async\f[R] scripts without
having to use preloading.
When early loading of a script is important, the priority can be used to
complement preloading, boosting the priority ahead of less\-impactful
resources that have a higher default priority.
.PP
Note that both the internal priority of any fetch operation, and the
impact of \f[CR]fetchPriority\f[R] on the priority, are entirely browser
dependent.
.SH VALUE
A string representing the priority hint.
Possible values are:
.TP
\f[B]high\f[R]
Fetch the external script at a high priority relative to other external
scripts.
.TP
\f[B]low\f[R]
Fetch the external script at a low priority relative to other external
scripts.
.TP
\f[B]auto\f[R]
Don\(cqt set a preference for the fetch priority.
This is the default.
It is used if no value is set or if an invalid value is set.
