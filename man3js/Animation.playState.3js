.SH NAME
Animation.playState \- Animation: playState property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The read\-only \f[B]\f[CB]Animation.playState\f[B]\f[R] property of the
Web Animations API returns an enumerated value describing the playback
state of an animation.
.SH VALUE
.TP
\f[B]idle\f[R]
The current time of the animation is unresolved and there are no pending
tasks.
.TP
\f[B]running\f[R]
The animation is running.
.TP
\f[B]paused\f[R]
The animation was suspended and the \f[CR]Animation.currentTime\f[R]
property is not updating.
.TP
\f[B]finished\f[R]
The animation has reached one of its boundaries and the
\f[CR]Animation.currentTime\f[R] property is not updating.
.PP
Previously, Web Animations defined a \f[B]\f[CB]pending\f[B]\f[R] value
to indicate that some asynchronous operation such as initiating playback
was yet to complete.
This is now indicated by the separate \f[CR]Animation.pending\f[R]
property.
.SH EXAMPLES
In the \c
.UR https://codepen.io/rachelnabors/pen/PNYGZQ?editors=0010
Growing/Shrinking Alice Game
.UE \c
\ example, players can get an ending with \c
.UR https://codepen.io/rachelnabors/pen/EPJdJx?editors=0010
Alice crying into a pool of tears
.UE \c
\&.
In the game, for performance reasons, the tears should only be animating
when they\(cqre visible.
So they must be paused as soon as they are animated like so:
.IP
.EX
\f[I]// Setting up the tear animations\f[R]

tears.forEach((el) \f[B]=>\f[R] {
  el.animate(tearsFalling, {
    delay: getRandomMsRange(\-1000, 1000), \f[I]// randomized for each tear\f[R]
    duration: getRandomMsRange(2000, 6000), \f[I]// randomized for each tear\f[R]
    iterations: \f[B]Infinity\f[R],
    easing: \(dqcubic\-bezier(0.6, 0.04, 0.98, 0.335)\(dq,
  });
  el.pause();
});

\f[I]// Play the tears falling when the ending needs to be shown.\f[R]

tears.forEach((el) \f[B]=>\f[R] {
  el.play();
});

\f[I]// Reset the crying tears animations and pause them.\f[R]

tears.forEach((el) \f[B]=>\f[R] {
  el.pause();
  el.currentTime = 0;
});
