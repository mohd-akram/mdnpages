.SH NAME
Request.mode \- Request: mode property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]mode\f[B]\f[R] read\-only property of the
\f[CR]Request\f[R] interface contains the mode of the request (e.g.,
\f[CR]cors\f[R], \f[CR]no\-cors\f[R], \f[CR]same\-origin\f[R],
\f[CR]navigate\f[R] or \f[CR]websocket\f[R].)
This is used to determine if cross\-origin requests lead to valid
responses, and which properties of the response are readable.
.SH VALUE
.TP
A \f[B]RequestMode\f[R] value.
The associated \f[I]mode\f[R], available values of which are:
.RS
.TP
\f[B]same\-origin\f[R]
If a request is made to another origin with this mode set, the result is
an error.
You could use this to ensure that a request is always being made to your
origin.
.TP
\f[B]no\-cors\f[R]
Prevents the method from being anything other than \f[CR]HEAD\f[R],
\f[CR]GET\f[R] or \f[CR]POST\f[R], and the headers from being anything
other than CORS\-safelisted request headers.
If any ServiceWorkers intercept these requests, they may not add or
override any headers except for those that are CORS\-safelisted request
headers.
In addition, JavaScript may not access any properties of the resulting
\f[CR]Response\f[R].
This ensures that ServiceWorkers do not affect the semantics of the Web
and prevents security and privacy issues arising from leaking data
across domains.
.TP
\f[B]cors\f[R]
Allows cross\-origin requests, for example to access various APIs
offered by 3rd party vendors.
These are expected to adhere to the CORS protocol.
Only a \c
.UR https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-filtered-response-cors
limited set
.UE \c
\ of headers are exposed in the \f[CR]Response\f[R], but the body is
readable.
.TP
\f[B]navigate\f[R]
A mode for supporting navigation.
The \f[CR]navigate\f[R] value is intended to be used only by HTML
navigation.
A navigate request is created only while navigating between documents.
.TP
\f[B]websocket\f[R]
A special mode used only when establishing a WebSocket connection.
.RE
.SS Default mode
Requests can be initiated in a variety of ways, and the mode for a
request depends on the particular means by which it was initiated.
.PP
For example, when a \f[CR]Request\f[R] object is created using the
\f[CR]Request()\f[R] constructor, the value of the \f[CR]mode\f[R]
property for that \f[CR]Request\f[R] is set to \f[CR]cors\f[R].
.PP
However, for requests created other than by the \f[CR]Request()\f[R]
constructor, \f[CR]no\-cors\f[R] is typically used as the mode; for
example, for embedded resources where the request is initiated from
markup, unless the \f[CR]crossorigin\f[R] attribute is present, the
request is in most cases made using the \f[CR]no\-cors\f[R] mode \[em]
that is, for the \f[CR]<link>\f[R] or \f[CR]<script>\f[R] elements
(except when used with modules), or \f[CR]<img>\f[R],
\f[CR]<audio>\f[R], \f[CR]<video>\f[R], \f[CR]<object>\f[R],
\f[CR]<embed>\f[R], or \f[CR]<iframe>\f[R] elements.
.SH EXAMPLES
In the following snippet, we create a new request using the
\f[CR]Request()\f[R] constructor (for an image file in the same
directory as the script), then save the request mode in a variable:
.IP
.EX
\f[B]const\f[R] myRequest = \f[B]new\f[R] Request(\[dq]flowers.jpg\[dq]);
\f[B]const\f[R] myMode = myRequest.mode; \f[I]// returns \[dq]cors\[dq] by default\f[R]
