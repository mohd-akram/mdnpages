.SH NAME
ChannelMergerNode \- ChannelMergerNode
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[CR]ChannelMergerNode\f[R] interface, often used in conjunction
with its opposite, \f[CR]ChannelSplitterNode\f[R], reunites different
mono inputs into a single output.
Each input is used to fill a channel of the output.
This is useful for accessing each channels separately, e.g.\ for
performing channel mixing where gain must be separately controlled on
each channel.
[IMAGE: Default channel merger node with six mono inputs combining to
form a single output.]
Default channel merger node with six mono inputs combining to form a
single output.
.PP
If \f[CR]ChannelMergerNode\f[R] has one single output, but as many
inputs as there are channels to merge; the number of inputs is defined
as a parameter of its constructor and the call to
\f[CR]AudioContext.createChannelMerger()\f[R].
In the case that no value is given, it will default to \f[CR]6\f[R].
.PP
Using a \f[CR]ChannelMergerNode\f[R], it is possible to create outputs
with more channels than the rendering hardware is able to process.
In that case, when the signal is sent to the
\f[CR]AudioContext.listener\f[R] object, supernumerary channels will be
ignored.
Number of inputs
variable; default to 6.
