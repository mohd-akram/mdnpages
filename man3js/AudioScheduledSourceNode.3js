.SH NAME
AudioScheduledSourceNode \- AudioScheduledSourceNode
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[CR]AudioScheduledSourceNode\f[R] interface\[em]part of the Web
Audio API\[em]is a parent interface for several types of audio source
node interfaces which share the ability to be started and stopped,
optionally at specified times.
Specifically, this interface defines the \f[CR]start()\f[R] and
\f[CR]stop()\f[R] methods, as well as the \f[CR]ended\f[R] event.
.RS
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R] You can\[cq]t create an
\f[CR]AudioScheduledSourceNode\f[R] object directly.
Instead, use an interface which extends it, such as
\f[CR]AudioBufferSourceNode\f[R], \f[CR]OscillatorNode\f[R] or
\f[CR]ConstantSourceNode\f[R].
.RE
.PP
Unless stated otherwise, nodes based upon
\f[CR]AudioScheduledSourceNode\f[R] output silence when not playing
(that is, before \f[CR]start()\f[R] is called and after
\f[CR]stop()\f[R] is called).
Silence is represented, as always, by a stream of samples with the value
zero (0).
.SH INSTANCE PROPERTIES
\f[I]Inherits properties from its parent interface,
\f[CI]AudioNode\f[I].\f[R]
.SH INSTANCE METHODS
\f[I]Inherits methods from its parent interface, \f[CI]AudioNode\f[I],
and adds the following methods:\f[R]
.TP
\f[B]start()\f[R]
Schedules the node to begin playing the constant sound at the specified
time.
If no time is specified, the node begins playing immediately.
.TP
\f[B]stop()\f[R]
Schedules the node to stop playing at the specified time.
If no time is specified, the node stops playing at once.
.SH EVENTS
Listen to these events using \f[CR]addEventListener()\f[R] or by
assigning an event listener to the \f[CR]oneventname\f[R] property of
this interface:
.TP
\f[B]ended\f[R]
Fired when the source node has stopped playing, either because it\[cq]s
reached a predetermined stop time, the full duration of the audio has
been performed, or because the entire buffer has been played.
