.SH NAME
Notification.requestPermission_static \- Notification:
requestPermission() static method
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f[B]Secure context:\f[R] This feature is available only in secure
contexts (HTTPS).
.PP
The \f[B]\f[CB]requestPermission()\f[B]\f[R] static method of the
\f[CR]Notification\f[R] interface requests permission from the user for
the current origin to display notifications.
.PP
The method returns a \f[CR]Promise\f[R] that fulfills with a string
indicating whether permission was granted or denied.
.SH SYNTAX
.IP
.EX
Notification.requestPermission()

// Deprecated syntax using a callback
Notification.requestPermission(callback)
.EE
.SS Parameters
.TP
\f[B]callback\f[R] \f[I](optional)\f[R] \f[I](deprecated)\f[R]
An optional callback function that is called with the permission value.
Deprecated in favor of the \f[CR]Promise\f[R] return value.
.SS Return value
A \f[CR]Promise\f[R] that resolves to a string with the permission
picked by the user.
Possible values for this string are:
.TP
\f[B]granted\f[R]
The user has explicitly granted permission for the current origin to
display system notifications.
.TP
\f[B]denied\f[R]
The user has explicitly denied permission for the current origin to
display system notifications.
.TP
\f[B]default\f[R]
The user decision is unknown; in this case the application will act as
if permission was \f[CR]denied\f[R].
.PP
The deprecated version of the method returns \f[CR]undefined\f[R].
.SH EXAMPLES
Assume this basic HTML:
.IP
.EX
<\f[B]button\f[R]>Notify me!</\f[B]button\f[R]>
.EE
.PP
It\(cqs possible to send a notification as follows \(em here we present
a fairly verbose and complete set of code you could use if you wanted to
first check whether notifications are supported, then check if
permission has been granted for the current origin to send
notifications, then request permission if required, before then sending
a notification.
.PP
Note that the request should be made in response to user interaction:
below, the method is called in the click event handler.
.IP
.EX
document.querySelector(\(dqbutton\(dq).addEventListener(\(dqclick\(dq, notifyMe);

\f[B]function\f[R] notifyMe() {
  \f[B]if\f[R] (!(\(dqNotification\(dq \f[B]in\f[R] window)) {
    \f[I]// Check if the browser supports notifications\f[R]
    alert(\(dqThis browser does not support desktop notification\(dq);
  } \f[B]else\f[R] \f[B]if\f[R] (Notification.permission === \(dqgranted\(dq) {
    \f[I]// Check whether notification permissions have already been granted;\f[R]
    \f[I]// if so, create a notification\f[R]
    \f[B]const\f[R] notification = \f[B]new\f[R] Notification(\(dqHi there!\(dq);
    \f[I]// \&...\f[R]
  } \f[B]else\f[R] \f[B]if\f[R] (Notification.permission !== \(dqdenied\(dq) {
    \f[I]// We need to ask the user for permission\f[R]
    Notification.requestPermission().then((permission) \f[B]=>\f[R] {
      \f[I]// If the user accepts, let\(aqs create a notification\f[R]
      \f[B]if\f[R] (permission === \(dqgranted\(dq) {
        \f[B]const\f[R] notification = \f[B]new\f[R] Notification(\(dqHi there!\(dq);
        \f[I]// \&...\f[R]
      }
    });
  }

  \f[I]// At last, if the user has denied notifications, and you\f[R]
  \f[I]// want to be respectful there is no need to bother them anymore.\f[R]
}

We no longer show a live sample on this page, as Chrome and Firefox no
longer allow notification permissions to be requested from cross\-origin
\f[CR]<iframe>\f[R]s, with other browsers to follow.
