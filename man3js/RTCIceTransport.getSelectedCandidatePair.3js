.SH NAME
RTCIceTransport.getSelectedCandidatePair \- RTCIceTransport:
getSelectedCandidatePair() method
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]getSelectedCandidatePair()\f[B]\f[R] method of the
\f[CR]RTCIceTransport\f[R] interface returns an
\f[CR]RTCIceCandidatePair\f[R] object containing the current
best\-choice pair of ICE candidates describing the configuration of the
endpoints of the transport.
.SH SYNTAX

.EX
getSelectedCandidatePair()
.EE
.SS Parameters
None.
.SS Return value
A \f[CR]RTCIceCandidatePair\f[R] object describing the configurations of
the currently\-selected candidate pair\[cq]s two endpoints.
\f[CR]local\f[R] describes the configuration of the local end of the
connection, while \f[CR]remote\f[R] describes the remote peer\[cq]s
configuration.
.PP
The return value is \f[CR]null\f[R] if no pair of candidates has been
selected yet.
.SH USAGE NOTES
As the ICE agent performs negotiation of a \f[CR]RTCPeerConnection\f[R],
it gathers and analyzes candidate configurations from each the two
peers.
As soon as it finds an acceptable matching pair of candidates, meeting
the requirements for the connection, a
\f[CR]selectedcandidatepairchange\f[R] event is fired at the
\f[CR]RTCIceTransport\f[R].
From that time forward, the best matching pair of candidates will always
be available by calling \f[CR]getSelectedCandidatePair()\f[R].
.PP
As ICE negotiation continues, any time a pair of candidates is
discovered that is better than the currently\-selected pair, the new
pair is selected, replacing the previous pairing, and the
\f[CR]selectedcandidatepairchange\f[R] event is fired again.
.RS
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R] It\[cq]s possible for one of the configurations in the
selected candidate pair to remain unchanged when a new pairing is
chosen.
