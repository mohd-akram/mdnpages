.SH NAME
RTCIceCandidateStats.address \- RTCIceCandidateStats: address property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]address\f[B]\f[R] property of the
\f[CR]RTCIceCandidateStats\f[R] dictionary indicates the address of the
ICE candidate.
While it\[cq]s preferred that the address be specified as an IPv4 or
IPv6 numeric address, a fully\-qualified domain name can be used as
well.
.PP
When a domain name is specified, the first IP address selected for that
address is used, even if the domain name maps to multiple IP addresses.
.SH VALUE
Either an IPv4 or IPv6 address or a fully\-qualified domain name, which
corresponds to the candidate.
.IP \[bu] 2
If the value of \f[CR]address\f[R] is comprised entirely of digits from
0\-9 with periods as separators, the value is interpreted as an IPv4
address.
.IP \[bu] 2
If the value is entirely comprised of hexadecimal digits and colon
(\[lq]:\[rq]) characters, it is interpreted as an IPv6 address.
.IP \[bu] 2
Otherwise, the \f[CR]address\f[R] is presumed to be a fully\-qualified
domain name, which is resolved first using an AAAA record (assuming IPv6
is available), then using an A record (if no result is found or the
device only supports IPv4).
If multiple IP addresses are returned in response to the query, the user
agent selects one, which is then used for the duration of ICE
processing.
.SH USAGE NOTES
The \f[CR]address\f[R] property was previously known as \f[CR]ip\f[R],
and only permitted IPv4 and IPv6 addresses to be used.
The addition of support for fully\-qualified domain names to be used for
the address brought about the renaming of the property.
