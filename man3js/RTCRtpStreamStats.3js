.SH NAME
RTCRtpStreamStats \- RTCRtpStreamStats
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]RTCRtpStreamStats\f[B]\f[R] dictionary is returned by the
\f[CR]RTCPeerConnection.getStats()\f[R],
\f[CR]RTCRtpSender.getStats()\f[R], and
\f[CR]RTCRtpReceiver.getStats()\f[R] methods to provide detailed
statistics about WebRTC connectivity.
.PP
While the dictionary has a base set of properties that are present in
each of these cases, there are also additional properties added
depending on which interface the method is called on.
.PP
\f[CR]RTCRtpStreamStats\f[R] is the base class for all RTP\-related
statistics reports.
.RS
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R] This interface was called \f[CR]RTCRTPStreamStats\f[R]
until a specification update in the spring of 2017.
Check the Browser compatibility table to know if and when the name
change was implemented in specific browsers.

.SH INSTANCE PROPERTIES
.SS Standard fields included for all media types
.TP
\f[B]codecId\f[R]
A string which uniquely identifies the object which was inspected to
produce the \f[CR]RTCCodecStats\f[R] object associated with this RTP
stream.
.TP
\f[B]kind\f[R]
A string whose value is \f[CR]\[dq]audio\[dq]\f[R] if the associated
\f[CR]MediaStreamTrack\f[R] is audio\-only or \f[CR]\[dq]video\[dq]\f[R]
if the track contains video.
This value will match that of the media type indicated by
\f[CR]RTCCodecStats.codec\f[R], as well as the track\[cq]s
\f[CR]kind\f[R] property.
Previously called \f[CR]mediaType\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]ssrc\f[R]
The 32\-bit integer which identifies the source of the RTP packets this
\f[CR]RTCRtpStreamStats\f[R] object covers.
This value is generated per the RFC 3550 specification.
.TP
\f[B]trackId\f[R]
A string which uniquely identifies the
\f[CR]RTCMediaStreamTrackStats\f[R] object representing the associated
\f[CR]MediaStreamTrack\f[R].
This is \f[I]not\f[R] the same as the value of
\f[CR]MediaStreamTrack.id\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]transportId\f[R]
A string uniquely identifying the object which was inspected to produce
the \f[CR]RTCTransportStats\f[R] object associated with this RTP stream.
.SS Common instance properties
The following properties are common to all WebRTC statistics objects.
.TP
\[ga]id
A string that uniquely identifies the object that is being monitored to
produce this set of statistics.
.TP
\f[B]timestamp\f[R]
A \f[CR]DOMHighResTimeStamp\f[R] object indicating the time at which the
sample was taken for this statistics object.
.TP
\f[B]type\f[R]
A string that indicates the type of statistics that the object contains.
.SS Local\-only measurements
These properties are computed locally, and are only available to the
device receiving the media stream.
Their primary purpose is to examine the error resiliency of the
connection, as they provide information about lost packets, lost frames,
and how heavily compressed the data is.
.TP
\f[B]firCount\f[R]
A count of the total number of Full Intra Request (FIR) packets received
by the sender.
This statistic is only available to the device which is receiving the
stream and is only available for video tracks.
A FIR packet is sent by the receiving end of the stream when it falls
behind or has lost packets and is unable to continue decoding the
stream; the sending end of the stream receives the FIR packet and
responds by sending a full frame instead of a delta frame, thereby
letting the receiver \[lq]catch up.\[rq] The higher this number is, the
more often a problem of this nature arose, which can be a sign of
network congestion or an overburdened receiving device.
.TP
\f[B]nackCount\f[R]
The number of times the receiver notified the sender that one or more
RTP packets has been lost by sending a Negative ACKnowledgement (NACK,
also called \[lq]Generic NACK\[rq]) packet to the sender.
This value is only available to the receiver.
.TP
\f[B]pliCount\f[R]
The number of times the receiving end of the stream sent a Picture Loss
Indication (PLI) packet to the sender, indicating that it has lost some
amount of encoded video data for one or more frames.
Only the receiver has this value, and it\[cq]s only valid for video
tracks.
.TP
\f[B]qpSum\f[R]
The sum of the Quantization Parameter (QP) values associated with every
frame received to date on the video track described by this
\f[CR]RTCRtpStreamStats\f[R] object.
In general, the higher this number is, the more heavily compressed the
video track was.
Combined with \f[CR]RTCReceivedRtpStreamStats.framesDecoded\f[R] or
\f[CR]RTCSentRtpStreamStats.framesEncoded\f[R], you can approximate the
average QP over those frames, keeping in mind that codecs often vary the
quantizer values even within frames.
Also keep in mind that the values of QP can vary from codec to codec, so
this value is only potentially useful when compared against the same
codec.
